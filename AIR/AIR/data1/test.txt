10051428_R315Z1T26EA8YK 5 i love these headphones i am totally satisfied with the sound and the fact that they stay in my ears they are greatand i love the color of course 
7063270_R3QLZUL02LTP06 2 happy for about 4 weeks using these in the gym the tips then lost the sponginess and then teared over time i kept my headphones in a case and yet they wear out when you use them after a few weeks
52760117_RPB5VZXVJP10L 5 i am loving the product comfortable fit good sound
41700667_R28UHV4PUON7O1 5 these headphones are amazing  the clarity is unreal  i would highly recommend purchasing a pair
44773818_R3165VLUJOLLX5 1 trash returned mine after 2 days the pads are hard and very uncomfortable it is completely plastic  and feels like it is  about to break dont buy
24439808_R17U6AU06HR16Q 5 great product
6864668_R2LO042MNWK9D8 3 these have good bass but at the same time even as a basshead i found these to be a bit boomy they almost have nothing but bass i did however get them to sound great with the use of the poweramp app on my phone but for the most part it is honest difficult to find a good spot with the equalizer and if using it with a device that has no poweramp app it will continue to sound boomy the highs and upper mids are much quieter in comparison the ear hooks in my opinion are uncomfortable i really wanted to like these headphones but they were just too 34high maintenance34 i felt like i was working too hard to be happy with them i want something that sounds and works good out of the box the customer buys and uses they dont work to make the product meet their expectations for these reasons i decided to return and went with the jaybirds bluebuds x they are more portable come with a hardshell case in comparison to the cheap mesh bag included with the photives feature better battery life sound better and are far more comfortable for me it was worth it to pay the extra money i hope they are durable enough to hold up but only time will tell
923498_R3PYZL964K50QT 1 bearly open up the package and only 1 headphone works great
12894448_R1IMULGYUNVXG3 5 cord tooooo long and plus not cl
1875597_RVNSXSEY846TC 5 excellent sound quality for both music and other av application movies tv etc
10621768_R3SEHRUZ8ZYU0Q 1 these headphones are a hit or miss ive ordered 3 pairs  the first one lasted a while but inevitably broke after years of good servicebr br so i ordered a second pair no bueno it literally went bad on the 2nd listen i procrastinated calling the customer support number the headphones came with and eventually lost the little piece of paper so i ended up buying a 3rd pair hoping the bad luck with the second was just a flukebr br the 3rd pair lasted literally a week before  it too broke basically only one of the headphones receives sound  regardless of what the headphones are plugged into no matter if its a computer a phone or something else  only the headphone opposite of the mic works  which is quite inconvenientbr br to make matters worse  half the time the sound quality of the working headphone is horrendous overall i really regret giving jlab another chance and buying from them their newer models just dont work  not sure what happened to the quality of their products but its crazy to have 2 different pairs of headphones stop working almost right awaybr br beware
28880268_R3OKGBXDA8SE7J 5 best headphones i have found at this price use it as my basic
8466125_R172BVMWOV9JU3 3 i dont have dr dre beats so i tested these on a normal pair of ear phones and i must say that they were a bit fiddly to fit but then once i had worked that out they seemed perfectly ample for the job in handbr br the reason i have only given them 3 is because they are being advertised as a replacement for an expensive set of earphones and i dont think the quality is brilliant and i dont think you would put these on expensive headphonesbr br but for a cheap and cheerful replacement for a set of cheap earphones then these are ample
2350876_RSYI8VFOLIG4B 5 my kindie needed headphone wa mic for school i was told by the teacher that this was one of the better set that the kids brought in they are perfect for my little guy and his school needs
50995112_RFIW1LCYXBE6Y 2 as sportswear headphones they might be great while skiing or something but they should not be in the sleep headphone category as they are not comfortable to sleep with
41375342_R31Y01GPXH7P64 4 work great sounds amazing
130104_R1X7M319NZ0ZIX 5 awsome
52526289_R3JYZIJ7EZWLGZ 5 i actually like these more than the bose quietcomfort line  way better audio
24960115_R3IXZ6DQ68W093 1 i bought these from bestbuy a few weeks back and i am incredibly disappointed with their shockingly poor qualitybr br after using them regularly i suddenly noticed that the leftchannel was slightly softer than the rightchannel this situation continued until the audio in the rightchannel unexpectedly decided one day to disappear entirelybr br i suspect that the wiring inside the earbud has broken and this should tell you everything you need to know about its poor constructionbr br now the leftchannel is barely functioning and sounds muffled one minute and then fine the next again i suspect the poor construction is the culpritbr br i could technically rma them to sony as it is within 30 days but i dont see the point on wasting money on shipping that could go towards a better pair from a different manufacturerbr br bottom line dont buy or youll regret it
2225289_R2FI6NQW3B8MPJ 4 they are not the most comfortable things and they only work really well while near fully charged but they get the job done and for the price you wont find any better
24154018_RWMNZFFWOIG70 5 great cable fits my hd598s perfectly and the red cable with black sleeving matches the brown on the headset much better than the black cable that came with the headphones the included 1434 screwon adapter is very high quality and the springstyle is a unique touch that matches the connectors very well definitely a great upgrade if you want something that looks or feels different from the stock cable or need a replacement cable
17560491_R3O51HYVAZEKD3 5 great product for the price
36831148_R1TPOMREYV3CCU 1 awful quality the ear pieces the mesh cover the inside bits all of them start falling apart within a week of light usesbr buy another brand waste of money
10203548_R16X4HJ1PVZP72 2 price is right but the sound is pretty bad
43855189_R3PSPYB0OCKATJ 5 these are great headphones i did a lot of searching and even sent back some seinheisers that didnt have what i was looking for let me make one thing clear the quality of this headphone can be replicated by cheaper headphones but not if you amp them i went 2 months without an amp and they were great dug real low on movies with bass and well there are other reviews about the awesome sound but frankly its a flat eq which was done on purpose and is a good thing but i bought them for their bass capabilities not for their ability to replicate audio without tarnishing it i used a fiio e17k and these things woke up you can adjust the bass treble and whatnot to remain flat and even then these things sound better add 4 or 6 to the bass eq though and these are funbr   some people mention that when you get high end headphones like these and an amp it just makes bad music stick out more it is unfortunately very true i can immediately tell which tracks on my ipod or on youtube were downloaded at low quality its painful to listen to but its completely worth it when you find good hq tracks because these babies put you in the studio bass guitars have concert like depth highs are not shrill the amp completely brings back the mids that some people have complained about not being up to par and if you throw on technotraprap  if youre into that sort of thing the d600s are thrilling ssbr   long story short these are great by themselves but if you want to actually experience them the way they are meant to be experienced and have some hard hitting not distorted or overbearing bass get them with an ampbr sidenote i almost didnt buy these because of a negative review about the headband being uncomfortable but i have a buzzcut a normal sizedshaped head  i think  and i have these on for hours at a time with no trouble they are in fact extremely comfortable and ive never had to take them off out of annoyance
22098324_R2JZUIDUFL34YL 5 this is really value for money have it for 2 yrs already and its still working great
50037367_R1T7X1RPWYTRBU 5 i think that these are by far the best headphones ive triedand over time ive tried many brandsbr they are comfortable and the sound comes through perfectly i lent them to my 16 year old son for his recommendation and had to nearly fight to get them back
47108763_R8JP8EMB6LPW7 4 good substitute for the original took some time to get the right fit but when you get it right its nice
38409284_R3U4N70PC74H6 3 worked good until my daughter broke the wire in less than 6 months i dont know if they can make the wires stronger for kids products
2969928_R31EDD7375WCWH 5 excellent product
50671424_R1AZSPSMIZG2E1 1 horrible sound  power button stopped working after two months and wouldnt take a charge  sharper image 34we dont really make these34 would not fulfill the 34satisfaction guaranteed or full refund34 promise that is clearly stated twice on the item description page but when i called amazon i was able to get a replacement shipped to me at no costbr br stay away
52331130_RM6SC4W6CMGAS 3 had to remove case to use these not quite as narrow as the description claims
51529929_RAAZD2N6YW6TT 4 for the price these are really good headphones  i recommend this to my friend
47475027_R268WDA1TRKRJB 1 inserted the cable into the hd7 dj and turned to lock it in place only to have the silver protective cover break off not well made at all

19545125_R3VCV4BC517I67 1 after only one week these buds were ripped by completely normal usage ive never had a pair of foam ear tips just fall apart like these ones didbr br as far as im concerned this was a waste of 15 bucks especially since i bought the three size pack not knowing which size was correct and now the one size that fit is ripped and useless after only being used a few timesbr br sure they may isolate well and fit comfortably but they have absolutely no durability
26818015_RMCETDQ1G3QE4 2 jiggly and weird  uncomfortable with no rubber earbuds  click and move aroundloosen when i walk  cant run in these

33831914_R2KF6RFXNU2GDQ 4 update 2  got through to them on the toll free number  no questions asked  they are sending me a new pair  these guys are good  update  now i get to check out the warranty  the jack broke on the headphones  special note dont put your phone in your pocket  i will let you know how it works out  the toll free number got redirected to some 4404665800  that is scary   so i had to send an email  what could go wrong  hopefully everything will work out  my snuggbud pumpd headphones developed a short  the jack  so i went on a search for new headphones because i am too lazy solder on another jack and i wasnt going to spend another 50  i scoured amazon for reviews and saw the four stars on the symphonized  i looked  symphonized nrgs  i read about others and kept coming back to the symphonized nrg  the bar for bass was set really high after using the snuggbuds  they rattled my head on the low end  i kept reading and looking then i decided to go for it and i ordered the symphonized nrg then waited  when they arrived i pulled them out of the box and pulled up youtube and hit play  not bad but not perfect  i changed the rubber bits for something bigger   still not right  good but they could be better since i wasnt using the snuggbuds any more i pulled the rub bits off them and put them on the nrgs  magic happened the bass was almost as good as the others but the frequency range was better on the nrgs  the nrgs had a wider range really god bass descent midrange and the high were crisp  plus for 15 bucks the nrgs were a 13 of the price and really good sounds for me  i like great deals and this was it  since my lovely wife signed us up for a marathon i thought i would try the nrgs out on a run  i did a 5k run and only adjusted them twice  they shut out the world just fine  you wont be disappointed for the price these rock  quite literally
20407139_R22LZ12W6YL6ZS 5 apparently our daughter is going through some sort of deafwish phase listening to music or the tv or really anything that shes interested in must be cranked to 11 for her to be happy or she complains 34i cant hear34 weve had her hearing tested its fine for real so when we were going on a roadtrip i was hesitant to buy headphones so she could listen to what does the fox say on repeat for 10 hours at a time without my sanity going out the window because i was sure she would end up damaging her hearing for goodbr br enter these headphones with awesome volume limiting abilities to add to their allure for her they were pink so we were both happy she got to listen to her favorite songs of all time and i got to know that she wasnt going to end up with hearing aides at the ripe old age of 10 plus no ylvis for me
3292733_R35W7OM9YTZW4T 5 wow
3004043_RTAMBSDGVPP84 5 great product
49199827_R2RCI9462M2MKJ 5 perfect for my husband to hear tv
52154652_R2BQT1C2V3W8CG 1 purchased these in april of 2015 as of august 2015 after approximately 12 total hours of use the left channel is completely dead
42147937_R3OZMIQ1RO58BT 5 great sound quality and fit love these headphones
13393796_R5AQXYXOCS2D3 5 this was suppose to be an early birthday or christmas present but the person it was meant opened it early and they love it this is one of the headphones the use more than any other one
10046449_R39IPO8KKV5ZFX 5 theyre pretty comfortable to wear for hours on end the bass part broke after a while though still functions great without it
47050351_R1RYR9EN9ZWZFL 5 i love skullcandys they sound great and inexpensive
24317412_RUFSZRPS7TWMB 1 i got it for free as a promotionbr they didnt fit anybodys head properly except for this one stuffed animal we havebr sound quality is lower than airplane earphonesbr build quality is cheap i could probably make these in my garagebr so flimsy that when i shake it up and down it is like a salt shaker dropping plastic shavings on my deskbr look so ugly i swear it was designed by shrekbr br the volume control and mic was nice i guess
42147937_R20S3HRLUUYJV2 5 these are the best headphones ive owned to date sound quality is phenomenal and the fit is awesome
4851540_R1PQPLJ9R2W8RA 1 i was so excited about getting the francois et mimi wireless bluetooth headphones my excitement was quickly squashed once i received the headphonesbr br the left earbud was missing its cover rendering the headphones useless the headphones came with an extra set of earbud covers which made me hopeful that i would be able to easily fix them unfortunately the replacement earbud covers did not even fit the earbuds im a little confused as to why they even bothered to send replacement earbuds knowing that they would not fitbr br very disapointed all around i ended up just throwing them out
33944398_R1GGEI8KE6R8WG 4 best for your money i use them every day
11147708_R3MWBWPV3AS2H2 3 decent pair of headphones if you just want to watch showsmovies but other than that the bass sounds really muddy with any music but oldies the headset didnt really fit my head it was sort of tight but that depends on your head so in the end i give this product a 35 note  one of the pairs i bought had a broken buttonthe headsets are cheaply made you get what you pay for
51067616_R1JP7MZTY3KHP9 4 products functions as advertised  the fit is a little loose
28544839_RG6QQ3B4MBIU6 1 dint charge my headphones at all
15721391_R5OBDS8D4OPPD 5 best headphones ive used hands down the clarity is unmatched will def recommend
51051398_R1KCGQT7HRU3BP 2 only one ear piece worked
21001467_RBUJARLKSJWS3 5 anker is top notch i might look at cell batteries next all cables that have had the anker name has been top quality one cable which is a usb micro has one thing missing before i could call it perfect though there wasnt bumps on the connector to tell which side is up without having to put your eyes on it so minor as theyre quality pieces and happy overall
44662810_R1TPZN6BTJLGO9 4 the in ear headphones worked quite well  a surprising value
8261847_RGUZ8J0LPPNXW 4 a fantastic bit of kit that ticks all the boxes when used whilst cyclinggreat sound quality but allows the wearer to hear traffic approaching from all directions as well as anyone speaking to youbr my only criticism is i have had two of the blues 2 afterskokz headphones and both had connectivity problems after about a yearthe goodness is as i had registered them under the 2 year warranty programme they were replaced with a new set within 10 days so great customer service
11219313_R3GORSMIGGN4YI 1 these are junk  ive gone through 2 pairs in 3 months the first pair broke came apart the second part stopped playing music out of the right ear bud after 2 weeks of use  will be looking for other headphones  i guess you get what you pay for
29730841_R373E1BAAI9CDK 2 these are awkward to put in and not comfortable to wear  for the money i prefer yurbuds  theyre more secure and a lot more comfortable
13880062_R3P5H4QKUL9Z13 5 excellent product great sound quality
52124747_R287R19MEMD1AJ 1 i just received these plugged into my phone and the sound is coming over the phone  the morons that made the plug have put too much rubber around it so i need to pare it down to fit in the case around my phone spigen  this is just dumb  the sony mdra35 had a slimmer jack which didnt have these issues
37292515_R2YTOH1KIOWL9L 5 bought these for my 4 year old son to ear on a flight to hawaii they worked great although after wearing them for a long time they do tend to hurt his ears but i think that is pretty normal he still uses them to watch his ipad great price for a good quality product we have had no issues with them
2602418_R2LUDAE6F9SHPA 1 the sound was pretty good until one of the speakers decided to stop working after 3 weeks of use  not worth spending the money on a product that does not last more than a month
10712640_R2TX67AEHYOJ4E 5 very lightweight and comfortable to wear when looking at them you expect a muffled sound but it actually has great sound it looks and sounds great
51647555_RJQZKKG5U8TH1 5 very clean sound comfortable to wear for long periods i use them for video editing audio is the most important component of communicating via video and these let me hear exactly what i am working with highly recommend
48612307_R22EN6KLYPGD99 4 its working as it should only been a month some spontaneous breaksstatics in the music but overall not a problem
22952596_RG40FO7CNWOG7 5 works tremendously well
3276230_R303YJ3K3AP73S 4 pretty comfortable nice design close to no noise cancellation though but theyre nice
41537429_R3MDE816A85EWS 5 bought these bad boys a little over a year ago and i used the crap out of them i keep them in my gym bag with my running shoes drop them constantly i sat on them numerous times on planes they finally gave up the sound stopped working on one side of the headphones i almost bought another pair but vmoda offers free repair for any technical issue even after the warranty expires i packed them up and shipped them to the factory in la less than 2 weeks later i get a package with my headphones fully functional and ready for another beating i highly recommend these headphones if they work for dj friends they work for me it would be unfair to even compare them to beats or any of those toy headphone
30987150_R3ICFJ6ZTTMO78 4 good sound quality bad mic quality no one can hear me when i use these things i can hear them perfectly but they cant hear me plus the part between the wire and ear bud breaks easily dont pull too hard its great for music especially for the price not great for talking on the phone
21548003_R3FU065M9VGLZ3 2 shortagestatic in them already
15317353_R1LB1UHJRUAEAG 5 these memory foam earbud tips are great replacement tips for my old worn out ones they are soft and fit snugly in my ear they improve sound quality and comfort
49560684_R3854QK0F08WEG 4 works great clear sound in and out  however i bought it for voip while playing games over speakers  the earpiece blocks enough sound i have to offset on my ear to hear the left speakerbr great for just voice chat not so great if you want to hear what else is happening in the room
31837971_RF9T6I2QI55AE 4 great price and great delivery the real issue is how long will they last
48383921_RQPUS7NRD2R2O 4 headphones work great i go through earbuds like shoes and these seem to be up to the challenge i just wish the cord was longer
11201087_R1Q2WUGO4R747N 5 im not very verbose in my reviews but i can say these headphones are every bit as good as others i have had in the past they remind me of the kind i used with my sony walkman way back when they fit comfortably enough given they way i wear them kind of like a stethoscope the bass response is plenty fine and the volume is also more than enough for me i tried the earbuds style that cam with my s4 phone and smh i do not care for something in my ear canal i still want to be somewhat aware of whats going on around me while the music plays these are also designed very well i will more than likely pick up another set or two just in case i cant find these ones again
27613311_R1XKBKBFTMLP7Q 2 the jvc earbuds were for my 15 year old daughter who runs cross country she wanted them for running they dont fit her ears on any kind of reasonable way she cant use them
51076545_R17D8E4KO0FS83 5 ive owned a number of headphones over the years and i know what i like  good quality earbuds for portable use clear and accurate sound reproduction no perceivable distortion over ear headphones for desk use and avoid anything that says 34enhanced bass34 like the plague i like dj type headphones because theyre closed so no one else complains about noise blocks external noise have a neutral sound quality if i want to tweak the sound i want to do it with an equalizer and i have a strong distaste for boosted bass as it tends to drown out the details of a musical piecebr br the closest thing i have to this is the sennheiser hd280 pro which i purchased in 2003 even taking inflation into account this one is still about 3 times what i paid for the sennheiser so whats the differencebr br the most obvious difference is the build quality the hd280 has come plastic clips on the headband they broke within the first week of me owning it and i was only using it at home i fixed them in place with clear packing tape and theyve held up well over the last 12 years but it was still very disappointing to have it break so soon after buying the a5pro is built like a tank lots of aluminum all over it is heavier than the hd280 of course but surprisingly not that much heavierbr br the headphones come with cushions that fit over the ear but in my case just barely id like larger ear cushions the cushions are easily removed and replaced with a slight twist the included cushions are 93mm in diameter 80mm onear and 110mm cushions are also available the cable is detachable locks in place when pointing down and  this is the part i really appreciate  can be attached on either the left or the right i thought i read that there is a shorter noncoiled cable with mic input available that can be used on a phone but i have not seen it for salebr br speaking of travel it can fold into a really compact size and comes with a simple cloth bag for transport when folding the cups up there is a pretty loud click as a plastic clip releases for it to swivel up this is the only part im worried about it breaking as it is not easily replacedbr br sound isolation is good but not as good as a well fitted pair of earbuds it also works both ways  it keeps external noise out and it keeps what youre listening to from leaking out the cushions are nice and soft and fairly comfortable but if youre not used to dj style phones you may find them tight and you will definitely feel the weight my hd280 feels more comfortable but it is like an old pair of shoes broken in and the comparison is not fair i recall the hd280 felt tighter when it was new as wellbr br ok enough about the construction and the great design how does it soundbr br it sounds great to me i hear all the details very clearly and it does appear to be quite neutral i have no way of measuring this except by comparing it to other headphones like the vmoda m80 which sounds a fair bit brighter bass is not artificially boosted yes but if youre listening to a bass heavy track you definitely can hear the bass i tried it with a range of music from classical to vocals instrumentals rock and it performs superbly compared to my hd280 it sounds more substantial dont get me wrong the hd280 sounds great but when comparing it side by side it sounded a bit hollow im sure im not using the correct audiophile terms for this the difference is not great but it is definitely there and easily heardbr br the headphones claim to be able to handle 3500 mw im not sure what 3500 mw will sound like but im pretty sure its a recipe for hearing loss when i first plugged it into my computer i had the volume at 40 it was loud on the bright side i didnt detect any distortion even at that ridiculous level that was not there at a lower volumebr br used with my phone the soundlevel seemed slightly lower compared to my earbuds but surprisingly not by muchbr br the only thing that gave me pause is the price it fluctuates a bit but no one is ever going to describe it as 34inexpensive34 it has a great design solid build quality and sounds great is it worth 3 times the price of the sennheiser hd280 pro thats a hard question to answer if youre not a professional dj if you like dj style headphones however it is definitely worth consideringbr br now i just need to figure out where to buy the 110mm cushions from
36356690_R184FOUNZZ7KO8 5 when i see the bose name and the price associated with their products my expectations are heightened  auditioning these over the ear headphones was a pleasure because they were comfortable musical and effectively isolated me from surrounding distractions  putting these headphones through their paces i saw no need to break them in  whether i was listening to orchestral solo instrument choral and solo vocal classical pop ragtime jazz or pipe organ the sound was rich free of audible distortion and mostimportantly wellbalancedbr br the same sweetness that i hear from string instruments in live concerts came through and throughout the audio spectrum from violin to bass  the intimacy transparency and clarity of these headphones brings through not just the music  during a handel oboe sonata i could hear the instruments keys clicking  every breath that the flutist was taking in my recording of poulencs flute sonata was clearly audible as was the breathing of violinist itzhak pearlman from his encores album  the highend sizzle that comes from live cymbals was reproduced clearly through these headphones as was the bonerattling 32foot pipe organ notes from virgil foxs performance of 34widors toccata34  the reproduction of 34chaiyya chaiyya bollywood joint34 from the soundtrack of the movie 34inside man34 was spoton  these headphones produce clear full bass notes without being overly bassheavy or rumblybr br for anyone who expects to hear reproduction of their music to be as close to a live performance as possible i believe that these bose soundtrue headphone should satisfy
11055888_R1AZ5DR86WRUYX 5 awesome product  it had no instruction manual but the shipper emailed it to me upon request  i love it
6396947_RGAGQQZGDSBL 1 these came with one earbud barely producing any sound i havent been able to use them at all but hey i got a cool case and a lot of extra silicone buds still i wouldnt recommend this product
43571903_R3NWRIAOM4YXO3 5 they were exactly as what we wanted they work great
50536268_R3MHVJWAW97KA1 5 okay they are basic headsets that are not super tough  but for 2995 they are fantastic  have used them in the gym for about 68 months now  use them in the garage working on my motorcycle or car  use them when my wife is trying to sleep and i want to listen to videos on my tabletbr br i wear hearing aids  in the gym i either had to wear my hearing aids and not listen to music or i had to listen to music with ear plug and shut myself off from others  these allow me to listen to music with good sound quality and hear what people are saying to me  i can wear them over my hearing aids without feedback  you can replay songs skip forward skip backwards change the volume and take phone calls not the best feature of this product but it worksbr br battery lasts for several days at the gym or one day in the garage  fast charging  for 2995 this is a great deal
53023463_RTRA3ZI3O5JDU 5 great headphone amplifier especially when mated with the other gadget that slips into this cradle to charge
2116415_R3EMBC6UU0SQR3 5 im very happy with this cable it is high quality and works perfectly
49613540_R3H95O6JESFCBG 5 this set of black carry bags are indeed premium all five are soft yet large enough for larger headphones some 34premium34 headphones dont come with carrying bags so these are great to keep handy i have a set of panasonic bluetooth headphones that didnt have a carrying case and they fit perfectly there is enough room to fully close the bag with the ties the inside is soft and wont damage delicate parts a great value very pleased with this purchase
15354510_R2PVSU0DD2JHCN 2 the did not get loud enough for what i needed 
19024187_R1ZYP2L2ZANPTO 5 i bought these at the beginning of this month and so far i love this product the sound is great i cant hear anything but the music and im able to easily take calls while im working out my objective of finding wireless ear buds that stay in my ears while im working out has been met so convenient and a must at the gym the one complaint i have is that i often find i have no life left on them half way through working out but i believe it is because i forget to power off after each use
50557968_R3L6WK86MI2L5Z 1 i dont get all these good reviews i listen to music all day long i cut grass for a living have for 20 years i always have earbuds in i go to the gym have for 10 years i always have earbuds in i do work around the house again always have earbuds in i know my earbuds these are terrible they sound so muddy theres almost no high end tried treble boost on my iphone 6 plus still terrible tried bass reducer and rock still terrible i listened to a podcast of first take and lil wayne was on it i couldnt understand what he was saying because his voice is so deep and monotone that it was basically distorted i listened to rock and hip hop and i still hate hate hate these earbuds i dont know how they had 48 reviews at the time i bought it and all were 4 to 5 stars you have to be kidding me and these earbuds are not broken they just are awful sounding ive been buying skullcandy with the built in mic because they are cheap and sound great especially at high volumes but as i said theyre cheap and the mic stops working after about a month and a half because i use them so much so i figured let me try and find a better quality earbud so i dont have to keep buying new ones well these are very well made as far as feel i have used them long enough to know if they break but ill just keep buying my old earbuds and just keep these as a backup till a new pair comes when an old pair goes theyre only 999 so i didnt even both getting my money back but i just had to write this review because all the great reviews about these earbuds and no bad reviews something smells fishy at least sounds fishy
49226996_R1IJ00UABCD2K4 3 great sound nice strong cord right angle plug is very convenient microphone is a little close to the earpiece and im seeming to have trouble disconnecting a call with one click there may be an intermittent break in voice communications but it may be my case not letting the plug engage snugly well see but its great so far
2500445_R33JZX2ML7Y5E8 3 it plays good at times in the water if the buds ware made not to let water in i would give a 4 and the facted that the clip broke on day 1 keeps it from ever getting a 5 over all not bad at all for 18
1249404_R62RXD0JWS2AE 5 100 worth it every time ive been using these for the past three and a half years and i just ordered my third pair the sound is amazing to the point where music from my mp3 player using different headphones sounds weird now a little steep for earbuds but its worth it on both of the pairs ive had before one of the ear buds has stopped working after a while but i mostly attribute that to all the abuse i put them through wires getting caught on stuff and pulling them out cramming them into tight pockets dropping my mp3 player and catching it by the headphones etc plus two pairs have lasted me 35 years i do wish they were a little more durable but other than that a great product

42668852_R1LPKL3NGACW0A 5 work great look awesome and the nylon feels amazing
5287970_R28O9DPSH6CYWT 4 these are the best set of headphones i have ever owned thee sound quality is great and they fit snug to my ears whether im working or working out somehow i have ran these guys through the washer and dryer twice and they still work and look flawless the only downfall is sometimes when i have my ipod in my pocket and i move into a position which my torso in between the ipod and headphones that the bluetooth starts to cut out must be my cyborg heart anyways great buy
1281567_R1PDYK9MHM1X8G 5 love them and the super fast delivery
28544839_R2YH4NA9UBU19Z 5 they work great had a small project that i needed an extra rca outlet for and this can in handy
35408164_R2JF0EC1FAPTH0 1 lousy product never could get them to fit my smaller ears and they are extremely uncomfortable to wear
51030415_R3RFES5L49OGIA 1 i have used this type of headphone for years  this pair has fallen apart after only a few wearings
13845834_R2A562Z00JRL3C 4 just got them  worked right away with my 2004 honda odyssey
3116782_RZETLPHZJFYB8 5 tldrbr   i ordered both the sennheiser urbanite xls and the sennheiser momentums and compared them for 30 daysbr   these are two quality wellpriced pairs of headphonesbr   i chose to keep the urbanites and return the momentums for two key reasonsbr   the urbanites are the most comfortable pair of headphones ive ever worn while the momentums put enough pressure on my ears that i need a break after over an hour of listeningbr    the urbanites are more portable and can be safely tossed in a backpack without a casebr   the differences between the two pairs arent in quality rather there are some specific characteristics for each pair that will make some people happier with one pair or the other a full comparison is belowbr   i ordered both pairs used off of amazon each for around 40 off the new price the packaging was opened but the two pairs were otherwise impeccablebr br soundbr urbanites  85br momentums  9br the overall sound quality was excellent in both pairs as a former bose employee i can say that each of this options will give you the kind of sound you would expect out of a 300 to 400 pair of headphones the biggest difference between them and generally between any similarquality headphones or speakers was the equalization as other review will tell you the urbanites really emphasize the mid bass a somewhat emphasize the deep bass while the momentums emphasize the mid range after adjusting the equalization to account for this the sound quality was quite similar i still found the urbanites to be somewhat tinny at the very top of its high range but overall they were both clear crisp and gave a very solid performance on a wide variety of tracksbr br for speech in this case many hours of cs lectures they were both excellent and easier to listen to than my external speakers the momentums gave a more engrossing experience which sounded like more like someone was right in front of you but the urbanites were actually a touch more comprehensible i know this because i consistently crank up the lecture speed to 20x  30x with the urbanites i could consistently increase the speed an additional notch or two without syllables becoming unclearbr br sound isolationbr urbanites  6br momentums  95br in this category i should emphasize that higher is not necessarily better the momentums absolutely block out sound and have a tight seal while wearing the momentums someone right next to me can call for my attention and i wont notice until they wave their hand the urbanites have good isolation in fact better than my last pair of phillips but outside sound can definitely leak in as someone working in an open office i do prefer having some sound leak through so i dont enter a conversation around me halfway through having no idea what was going on in this aspect the urbanites are a good balance for mebr br however if total isolation is an important part of your listening experience you will absolutely get more of that out of the momentums it should be noted that isolation goes both ways and you can probably crank up your music a little louder with the momentums without anyone hearingbr br comfortbr urbanites  10br momentums  45br this was the dealmaker for me i listen to music 80 of the workday and for several hours a week listening to video lectures i honestly have never worn a pair of headphones that is as comfortable as the urbanites are i can wear them 10 hours a day without any discomfort which has never been true of other overear headphones for me and certainly not true of any onear or inear headphonesbr br the momentums are by no means terrible when you put them on however after 12 hours of use for me i needed a break the aforementioned tight seal is obtained by putting a reasonable amountof pressure on your temples and the cups are just slightly too small for my ears your experience may vary in this regard but its clear that the urbanites are the winner in the comfort categorybr br aestheticsbr urbanites  5br momentums  7br im no fashion authority ill just give my two cents i dont really find any pair of overear headphones attractive when theyre on your head youre going to look a little bit like mickey mouse regardless of what headphones you choose that said i did find the momentums to have a nicer refined look that i could imagine someone wearing in a highly corporate setting without a second glancebr br durabilitybr urbanites  9br momentums  7 out of the case 10 in the casebr the momentums come with a nice hardshell case which protects them well that said i couldnt bear the thought of anyone throwing them in a backpack without that case the plastic top and metal sides do feel durable but their sheer geometry allows stray items to press against their drivers which are more vulnerable than the urbanites and the fact that they dont fold means that throwing your backpack down somewhere could unintentionally cause their aluminum supports to bendbr br the urbanites cups fold in an awesome feature folded theyre less than half the volume of the momentums case and theyre in a more protected and flexible position this combined with the fact that the whole pair of headphones is incredibly flexible makes for a remarkably durable set of cans the drivers themselves also have a hard plastic cage over them underneath the fabric covering which makes me less worried that stray items will press directly against the drivers and muck with their ability to performbr br these are both pairs of headphones that look like theyre built to last if theyre just sitting on your desk id even put my money on the momentums outlasting the urbanites however the urbanites are built to last inside a backpack suitcase or messenger bag without needing a casebr br which brings us tobr br portabilitybr urbanites  95br momentums  7br the momentums case does deserve some credit here its light its durable and its a lot less bulky than some other headphones you might see that said its still a case you still have to unzip it and you still have to adjust your headphones away from the positions that fit your head to the positions that fit the case every time you want to take them anywhere for someone leaving their headphones at home this probably isnt a big deal but for someone constantly throwing them in a backpack and biking to work it is a bit of a pain the small folded position and flexibility in the absence of a case make the urbanites one less thing you have to think aboutbr br overallbr im not going to give an overall score these are different pairs of headphones the momentums give you an immersive isolated sound experience while the urbanites are more comfortable and more more portable after my month of testing i chose the urbanitesbr br on buying usedbr these headphones both seemed worth their sticker price but at the end of the day i saved around 40 and got headphones that as far as i could tell were identical to a new pair obviously your results may and will vary but the return policy on amazon is the same with used items as it is for new items so you arent necessarily stuck if you get a bad pair i would definitely buy headphones used from amazon againof pressure on your temples and the cups are just slightly too small for my ears your experience may vary in this regard but its clear that the

14770785_R1GHZEKOQBYY36 2 if i push the headphones in all the way i only get sound to left ear even though it is a mix of left and right audio and the mic input doesnt work i figured out that if i dont push it in all the way i can get the mic to work and get audio in both lr ears but the audio is still a mixture of lr audio ex left ear audio from computer is heard in both ears same for right audio using with samsung earbuds with mic that came with my galaxy s4
12320085_R2M8EFTWBNB889 4 4 of 5 stars just wish the cable length was longer
11586780_R1W21M9WHOUPGA 5 seems like great headphones the first ones i got had a blown speaker i called the company and within 2minutes and zero questions later i had new ones in the mail at no cost to me i was bummed at first but after dealing with their customer service department i am sold on these head phones only problem ive noticed is the cord can rub on your shirt causing a scratching noise in the buds but its not super noticeable over all great buy for the money
45407233_R3PRKX2K7HFARK 4 are these the most powerful headphones i have ever wrapped my ears around  yes  best sounding  more than likely  most durable  definitely yes on that one  durability is certainly their middle name and with a price tag like that you will definitely appreciate it  the frame is composed from light metal material so while they are solid and tough to break they do come at a cost of being slightly heavy than your average headphones  they are about 14 ounces  they are certainly not subtle either if you choose to wear them outside  certainly they can cause fatigue after a prolonged usebr br it includes a 35  63 mm adapter for dj purposed but it will certainly play on your phone as welli was able to use it just fine on a samsung s4 phone  there is just one pair of ear cushions which should fit most ears out there  however for a price tag like that they couldve added several instead of making you buy addition sizes for extra pricebr br these are not in a direct competition with dr dre beats as i dont think that is what philips is trying to do here  dr dre is more stylish and designed for personal use while these are designed for personal and dj use and are extra durable  sure they are pricey but as always  you get what you pay for  it also includes a nice carrying case as these can be folded as well
1875698_R2ZG0QIQEZ9TSQ 5 its a wonderful headphone i didnt tried bose headphones but i think it is better than dr beats 
1038119_RUHHNXO86A422 5 shipped fast and work fine
7147038_R7XMFZHZ6QPBQ 5 had to return first ones but still awesome
23080416_R1JE59KA74XPSG 1 bought these 3 months ago  for 3 months they were great for my needs  they are now broken can barely hear any sound out of them  they just went
9944198_R3BB1LJC7BM31F 1 it is a very flimsy product  i got it i openned the  box  put the headphones over my ears and plugged it in nothing  money thrown away there was no one to talk to amazon doesnt want customers bothering them so they do not make it easy to call them up my other alternative is to call the federal trade commission  in short i am telling you this i would not waste my money getting this  get something that works
14798919_R2CI6TXIGZR6RU 5 they work great
49668221_R2Z5FDROON8SC1 5 it works as advertising
45894275_R2OJSEM3D48RD4 5 very good low latency wireless bluetooth transmitterreceiver i use one as transmitter and another as receiver and the delay is very small so i can ignore it easily i wish it has volume button
15497866_R39D1XPRXWYJOR 4 purchased for my wife  she says the earbluds and microphone work as expected
1228781_REXPWNLNDTZEE 5 she loves them
32717209_R2DP5IS7QE27IE 3 they sound quality is great but the the only problem is the mic it works well but its located really low on the chord you need to hold it closer to your face so people can hear you
24133606_R1BG5NL9AX68QE 1 knockoff alert so im in a box box store and i see these after giving the pair i bought to my son because to me they sounded horrible hmm the silver part isnt as shiny big box version looks better made so i bought them and compared to the amazon ones i gave to my son after adequate burnin timeall i can say is theres a huge difference there is no way the ones i purchased from amazon are the real dealno way buy the real ones and theyre awesome whereas these sold thru amazon are junk id give the big box store rea version 4 stars for the price 4 stars is excellent these will never replace the xb90exs i own i own 2 pair 1 use 1 as a spare in case others die but those are reserved for dedicated listening sessions being active the real xb50s are my goto choice
15115304_R29LS3LD8YPMRZ 4 the quality is good but design is poor the actual connectors should have been made smaller because they have a hard time fitting in my phone case and in my headphones
22237509_RVM8DVY9WGWGM 4 sound equipment on handbr etymotics er4pbr grado sr60br jaybird bluebuds xbr br my sound preference includes neutral mids and bass with a slight emphasis on the highs  usually anything from grado fits the bill for me sonically  i regard anything thats bass heavy a la any beats headphones or midheavymuddy skullcandyapple headphones as crap  so please consider my preferences as your expectations may differ from minebr br the blu100 sound the most like grados  the highs are bright but the bass has more of a presence without being boomy or muddy  i was actually very impressed with them the first time i fired them up  for 40 i was expecting the sound of 20 headphones but with the addition of bt  pleasant surprisebr br the bluebuds x have more subdued highs with slightly more exaggerated bass  to me a bit less clarity which is unfortunate because its nearly 34x the cost of the blu100br br where the blu100s fail is reception  if you keep the full length of the cord draped across your back most likely your reception will be fine  i attempted to shorten the cord by folding it over itself a la the bluebuds x but once you do you lose massive range on the headphonesbr br my original intent was to use the blu100 with its long cord folded on itself and tied behind my head paired with my android wear moto 360 smartwatch  but when the cord is folded you bt signal becomes weak and the audio becomes choppy  but if you allow the blu100 to drape without any folding of the cord reception works fine on the android wear device  for me this wasnt an option so i had to return itbr br otherwise the fitment is fine with the comply tips and i had no issues with these staying in while sprinting
1808626_R3D4EGOCQ8FL55 5 warning if wearing this their a big chance of u not hearing any one near u
2988844_R1CAZ77S79ELMS 5 as great as other wireless earphones but much cheaper and its pretty good
3410356_R3CHCC5R4RRF3Z 5 i am writing this review while listening to these headphones and i absolutely love them i am a complete audiophile but on a budgetbr the styling of these headphones is out of the ordinary and i love it they seem durable so far but i havent owned them long enough to know if they truly last long the carrying case provided is extremely stylish and seems durable carrying the headphones in the carrying case is a must if you want these headphones to have a long lifebr br ive used monster dna headphones for the longest time thinking that they were the best in ear headphones at this price point ive owned the same pair for the last two and a half years and theyre still going strong granted one of the plastic covers came off on the headphones but superglue fixed that problem the highs and mids of the dnas are pretty clear but you could tell that the bass is a little too strong even for my liking i enjoy listening to rap and hip hop daily so i enjoy a overly healthy amount of bass in my audio equipmentbr br after looking into a pair of backup headphones i checked these out and ordered a pair i paid 38 for these compared to 55 for the dnasbr after seeing the top review for this item i was excited to see if these headphones would truly 34change the way i listened to music34 well let me tell you these do just that the diesels completely blew me away i still get chills when i listen to music everyday with these the mids and highs are clearer than any other headphone ive ever listened to ever ive listened to pretty much every other monster headphone and these are the ones that stick out majorly each layer of sound in each song is separated beautifully you can honestly hear each individual instrument on its own when you listen to country rock or any other type of music when you listen to hip hop and rap you can hear each individual component of the song crystal clear let me note on the bass of these headphones too they arent overpowering like the dnas not even close in fact theyre dead accurate at reproducing the exact bass note no matter what music youre listening to these healthily blend the mids highs and lows for the most perfect balance ive ever heard ive heard parts of songs that ive never heard before with these headphones i cant believe i got these for 38 i feel like i stole them for that pricebr br my girlfriend listened to these headphones once and told me how much she loves them she has a pair of bose headphones and says that these headphones blew her away i just ordered her a pair and am considering ordering myself another pair in case i lose thesebr br the monster dnas are now my backup headphones however i might order another pair of diesels as a backup and just use the dnas as a working out headphone i cannot express how much i love these headphones buy these and they will change the way you listen to music
128798_RCDVD8OHCZS16 5 my nephew is happy with these ear buds
50967135_R8RGMDT6MNBAM 5 these headphones are so much more than an ordinary pair of headphones or earbuds they allow you to listen to your music or podcasts wirelessly via bluetooth and will connect to two different devices this is perfect if you want to share your headphones or you own two devices my son uses them whenever he mows the lawn and i like to take them along when i walk the dogbr br here’s what else i lovebr br   you can easily switch between your music and your phone if you need to take a callbr   all of the controls you need to access are conveniently locatedbr   the headphones are comfortable to wearbr   charging your headphones is easy and the battery lastsbr   there are no long cords to get tangledbr br note i was provided these headphones free of charge for review purposes but all opinions are my own
4846280_R2QM8190LN3VKY 5 great pricevery happy with this purhase
9295389_R20XQRMFD7UW4X 5 out of the box i wasnt 100 sure how to use this or test it properly so i asked a few friends that are much more versed in this area than i am after they instructed me here is what i found this little amplifier has two main uses as a headphone amplifier and a stereo speaker amplifier this being a bluetooth device i did everything through syncing and didnt use it as a direct port however you can directly plug into it this package comes with a 12v power cable that is needed for powering speakers however if you want to use this amplifier for your headphones you can just use any usb cable i know i barely even dove into the full potential of this device but what i did test it worked amazing sound quality is great easy to use once you figure out what you are doing and super durable it just has a great feel to it like its going to actually last and not end up in the trash in a month or twobr br i did receive this device at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review
33220011_R27LXAIXERH1Q8 5 great little headphones thanks sennheiser love you guys
28448501_RJRIIN7AG2000 5 good product  bought it from unique photo in nj  it arrived before the scheduled datebr all in the sealed box so two thumbs up 
39380595_R1POFS3MWR5N8X 1 the earphone keeps breaking every 4 months this is my second pair and the same one broke
2932101_R23XXANX2YIB8M 4 awesome earbuds came with interchangeable sound filters and real wood
472775_R2AN66L3MJJNY9 5 it works perfectly thanks
23140149_R2F3H8CYGMVKFH 1 while it was working it was good  however it barely made it a year before it stopped working  for 140 it should at least have been replaced by the seller or the manufacturer  but neither will replace it
36076043_R1E0JH8NUW2PXC 5 these ear buds are really nice for the price once you figure out the best way for you to use them  i have used etymotic ear plugs for years so i can attend concerts and movies and work with power tools without doing any further damage to my ears so i know how to properly insert the 3 flanged buds  i tried both sizes of the 3 flanged tips but neither worked well  the sound was kind of tinny  then i tried the foam tips  wow  what a difference  for me the foam tips provide both the best noise isolation and the best sound quality  i am not a audiophile but i have spent many years of my life playing in orchestras so i do know quality sound and these ear buds provide that for me
52109908_RQ8REN6SLBJAN 1 holds buds at an awkward angle so i cant put them in my ears
23525810_RRAX5M6TCHXF 5 absolutely loves these head phones very comfortable unlike the ones you get with a new cell phone high quality sound no scratchy sound like you get with other headsets i will be getting more for christmas gifts these works great with my ps4 for audio so i can talk with my family and friends far away while playing games these were giving to me for free for my unbiased honest opinion
16979386_R1ZLQYYJAFRZXF 5 probably one of the best
41961257_R1662FOBD5RLPF 5 great amp for the price great finish  a loudness control would have been helpful but their absence does not compromise the amplifier s performance
16990542_RCMVUKFK5A8R9 2 they probably work for other types of headsets but these do not work with apple earpods beware
27411856_R3PZXT8GQR49N7 5 a great pair of bluetooth wireless headphones i have a pair of beats wireless ear buds as well and compared to them the sound quality here is slightly inferior however the function is great fit is good and prices is about 75 lessmaking these great headphones  the key advantage of these photives is that they are truly sweat proof unlike the beats check for product reviews on amazon and applecom and many beats wireless earbud owners complain that they stop working if they get sweat on them which happened to mine after having for 1 month  apple store gave me a new pair as they do everyone for the first yearand the same thing happened again these can get sweaty without a problem and keep working
2155002_RLG4PEXC3ET3I 5 needed some spares after having the foam fall of my earphones and me not being able to find them best part is they are washable just run them through some water and dry them up then theyre good to go again
52621087_RHQ2YKFPU0NKR 5 the only tips i use anymore
22172716_R3C2KKA7S9IR4I 5 great
50908767_R1BE585YA339TA 3 great for listening to music on fire tv or other devices but the sound is not in sync with the video on movies or tv programs on fire tv
43742349_RV2WESPTEVA1R 2 when they work they work well comfy good quality and great microphone connectivitybr try as i might though i just cant get them to work consistently these go through long periods of time where the sound just breaks up like a cell phone call going through a tunnel it will be crystal clear for a few seconds then become completely garbled even if i havent moved at all in relation to the receiver i will be returning these and trying another brand because they have become completely useless
5183426_R333S48K6GAU8 5 best ear buds for the price very comfortable to wear and the sound is very decent
11581740_R22MBEAQW23JE6 5 great headphones theyre very secure and we found out once we got them home that theyre adjustable and fit even better than we thought
14552141_R38NF92J0B0VDM 5 very nice 
5175021_R2OKA65DEQWT2L 5 my 6yr old loves these and they fit perfectly  yay
18067281_R37KF8VRBUZNQD 5 works fine
12663591_R25JP4I2WNQBU5 5 my little granddaughter was so excited when she opened her gift  i had an older set just like this by sony and she used it ever time she came over  i was pleased to be able to find one like mine
33427142_R1B95HG2KBGPCF 5 cant stop listening i have a collection  20 plus speakers receivers and other equipment ive listened to headphones but havent bothered to take them seriously ive owned grado psb denon and sennheiser  bought the hifiman 400s after reading a review and cant stop listening i know they havent been broken in yet but so far just blown away listening with the sony hap music server or vintage audio or using dragonfly the sound is incredible these phones are easy to wear very comfortable and the sound is silly good  great soundstage bass can hear passages that i never knew were there buy these
49766262_RAXWOI3GCQKUU 1 i have been using wired headsets that were not much cheaper but the cordswires keep going bad and i go through one about every three months as i work from home and have a lot of conference calls this bluetooth headset has been great  sound clarity is perfect  range is incredible as it has worked through two floors when i forgot to turn it off one time  i have it connected to a work phone lg vista 3 and a personal cell phone samsung galaxy note 4  so far i have had no issues  i charge it at least every other day but that is because im on it all the time  battery life seems very solid though  it uses a standard usb so easy to charge wheneverwherever you need it very comfortable to wear  updated 09162015  i really liked the feel and sound of this headset but six weeks in and it no longer accepts a charge  i might just have been unlucky and got a defective unit but i dont want to keep rolling the dice
39814138_R3UI0SFMCLT3HY 1 poor quality not even sure they were authentic but amazon guarantees the sale
21273741_R28X1ASDLPL3C9 4 it takes quite a while to charge and doesnt hold a charge for as long as i thought it would  but it works great in an emergency
41704217_R1OCE5Y7H3O3KA 3 produces feedback when touching the cable
50084077_R1YWRSZAJM9E1V 4 good headphones for the price if you want good bass response from an inear headphones i would recommend these the overall sound quality is equivalent or better than the beats headphones i tested out during my search since purchasing the xtcs i have not used used my 100 sol republic v10 headphones would give a 5 star but i need to see how long the xtcs will last if i need to replace these headphones i will definitely consider buying again
37330069_R1ANGYUQ1H3K0Z 5 a little smaller than i expected but still high quality my mistake but i will use them for something else and i will buy from this company again thanks
17895966_R27HS8HZYLNLGT 3 while its clear these headphones deliver crisp sound and good bass for a fantastic price i find that the shape of the earbud itself causes me some discomfort the main part of the earbud projects backward from the soft rubber part that inserts into the ear opening this presses into my ear in a way that hurts if i wear these for a long time they may not be a good fit for smalleared people
10008852_RA8R84N9JMZLD 3 my dad loves this only issue is charging it does not make proper connection and he has to place something on headphones so they charge i dont think this should be correct
12306766_R1RT915BLPXGUF 4 i had to replace my daughters earphoines and she loved these
20031745_R3N5FXEPRG51J9 5 good
43798153_RAS0L46IWDR27 4 great hands free device
47354716_R3FO0UCQ2F4ATY 2 im sure these headphones might be good for some but for me they fell short not enough depth and clarity for me personally
7283235_R3P6R73G7E83XA 1 one side ear plug stop working so im sending this back
52408729_R2NB7PGJTPZUAB 1 had this item 3 months and it no longer works  waste of money
26960133_R3FXQ2G21K4T0N 5 not sure if the wood makes a difference acoustically or not but these are amazing earbuds they sound great and i love the carrying bag
8812824_R1GW6TEDPFC6OS 5 perfect
116239_R3JWJ71BRCSY34 5 unbelievable price for these highquality wireless earphones very wellmade a good look amazing stereo sound a must buy
51451185_R1JJECIQ4CH34Z 5 maybe the best set of earbuds i owned long batter life and short recharge period syncs up perfectly with my phone computer and playstation 3 very useful product and the e tronic edge is a great company to buy from i will be buying more products from them
28729910_R7H47WJUZ2KZI 4 so far im am happy with this product the sound is decent for the price  it is made with a cheap looking plastic which looks like will break the first time i drop it on a hard floorsurface  but it is easy to sync and all functions are fairly self explanatory
13801745_R2OHYHC7PERTQD 5 love the sound this produces when i use with any headphone  but especially my akgk553s
10635927_R2DYA5QMT1RS9W 5 i can say that this is the best bt headphone i ever used  i was impressed that audio quality for is identical for cable connection  i had harman bt ant the sound was very lowbr the bass was great and i was expecting low bass since it has sensitivity 98 db compared to my vmoda m100 105 dbbr br cons great bass specially in deep bass thanx to the frequency response 4 khz  100 khz crisp sound high bt volume design and color touch controlbr br pros lot of plastics low db leads to little bit low bass but it still there good bass touch control lag need to reconnect bt high price for plastic looks premium
20031369_R3M25IYCSNVS3N 5 love them
47511516_RJXYVQYSFYFVT 5 just what i wanted
51273464_R1ZKGAP3YUS85A 3 assuming you can get the buds sealed in your ears correctly the package includes small medium and large silicone tips they sound fine  as another recent reviewer noted though changing the tips is not an easy task  they are packaged with the medium ones installed but i needed to switch to the large ones  removing the mediums was easy but putting the large ones on required some fine motor skills    the earpiece assembly looks like it will be very durable and i also like the rightangle jack    im deducting a star for the tip replacement issue and another one because the highs arent as clear as they are with my other earbuds for 7 though theyre really good especially if you have medium sized ears
37133198_R3CF2ZTWJW825F 4 sound quality of the akgs is excellent broad accurate soundstage rich but not over pushed basebr but i agree with some other viewers that these phones fit to snugly and can be a literal headache tobr wear for over an hour thats a shame because they are like other akg phones i have had sonicallybr a real listening pleasure
43183924_R2XNIMD3162EN7 5 rugged and durable im no audiophile i just like to listen to music once in awhile every single aux cable i have ever had before this is done for life in a vehicle is not kind to wires constant pullingtugging being stepped on tangled in the console or glove box and so onbr i have not had it long enough to know how it will hold up but so far its the best i have had it really does resist tangles ive kept it in my backpack pulled it out without a problem and plugged my phone into my head unit i know first hand that doing this with ordinary aux cables required the knots and tangles to be undone not an issue with this one
2324270_RWNTIV1HE097H 3 i thought they would of been louder
32096243_R12FYLJ13F3G01 1 the cd player does not work imposinle to vontact distributer to make a return
45760887_R1KV1I0XX5QAB1 1 broke after 2 months of rare use could never get the fit quite right i have a big head thoughbr br was great for trail running because you cant snag the cord
57629_R1SGU1IZX7N2YX 3 the bass is way too boosted in these being a sennheiser product i expected a nice even equalizer between bass and treble there is just way to much bass even with my phone or ipod equalized all the way to the treble side
366511_R1Z8T58H0WTSA0 3 not a bad product but for the price i was expecting slightly better for me the biggest thing is that the highs sound very tinny at least to my ears if it wasnt for that they would honestly be very good earbuds the tinniness is almost unbearable at times though and gives me a headache on some songs listening to whams last christmas puts me in tearsbr br that being said theyre very durable earbuds feeling them you can tell theyre high quality the earbuds themselves are solid and the cord is very lightweight the asymmetrical design took awhile to get used to but im really liking it now i found these while looking at a list of durable earbuds and ive gotta say so far theyve lived up to that standard if only i werent considering buying a new pair anyways because of this god awful tinniness
10302683_R3B7EJS5AO26C5 1 way too big
23332160_R2RW5DWXZRCJEL 5 i bought these in pink so my son would quit stealing my earbuds  he used them to mow the lawn in a bind and now uses them every time because he said it keeps out the background noise of the mower  i had to buy him his own set in black
18980461_RP4CARW2KTJ6R 5 love the colorperfect design
18766387_R9IECXPD225ZR 4 can not give it a 5 because the rating can not be universal i have small to average ear size these may not cover the entire ear of someonebr with very large ears and allow outside noised to mix in
51832538_R3001UP44K37N9 5 beautiful headphones and still five years later working perfectly
26970005_R3NC7OK51BVLI3 1 this has been my worst buy the mic stopped working after a few days and within the week so did the earphones not a genuine apple product i dont recommend it and if you want apple earphones i suggest not getting any that are less that 20
31992520_R3EJZDSJWOWGOU 5 great for flying and 2 12 yr old thinks they are great
15142332_R3BY90K11UTKNW 4 good quality product music sounds good just be sure to use right size ear plug they give you couple sizes it will make a difference with sound

1374765_R3CZSMCYYUF9KU 1 its just the skin i didnt read it carefully dont make it look like headphones
21139766_R1VXGSKW8W0YXY 4 prosbr 1 strong clear sound for lowend audio and portable devices does a great job at what it was designed to dobr br consbr 1 not a comfortable fit i have to slant the headband forwardbackward to reduce pressure on the earbr 2 not audiophile quality obviously you shouldnt expect audiophile quality from a 15 headphone but if you really want to have fun listening to music i suggest investing in a good pair like grado or sennheiserbr br note cutting out the foam inside the cups seemed to help improve the sound a bit doing so will also obviously void your warranty lol
10723569_R3TKZXBKSRP9OF 1 if you like bad sounding audio these are the headphones for you
43945590_R2AMR52XPP59SJ 5 so happy to have earbuds that fit my small ears

16993678_R3E42P6I3E3ZV9 5 wonderful for kids great fit durable very cool design
38377528_RMYEIZ48FCZU8 1 i was foolishly surprised at the size of this thing i just assumed that it would be a reasonable size certainly no bigger than my teac 501 or mytek stereo dsd both of which also have balanced outputs and also play dsd i was floored when the box arrived at 1934 wide and 2234 deep it wont fit on any of my media shelves or equipment racks still had it performed well i probably would have kept it i wasnt expecting sound on the same level as my teac or mytek but i did think that it should be on a par with my 200 ifinano which also plays dsd and is only the size of a pack of cigarettes boy was i wrong regardless of resolution the xda2 obscures detail rendering music lifeless instruments are blurred together and voices are hard to distinguish in addition it certainly doesnt meet its snr specs in either the preamp or head phone amp mode i couldnt believe that i heard noise through my sennheiser 600s even at very modest volume levels thats a first for me with any dac ive tried then i cranked up the volume driving my new parasound a23 amp in balanced mode with quality interconnects and guess what more noise believe me when i run the teac mytek or ifi dacs through the parasound at full volume theres total silence the final clincher was the issue with the windows 10 driver my antivirus software wouldnt let me download it so i had to disable my virus protection in order to get the driver form emotiva this driver would not recognize the xda2 on all of my windows 10 computers although i was able to find a c media driver that would still there is a serious issue with either the c media or emotivasupplied driver in windows 10  when the xda2 is turned off and on or disconnected while the computer is running you have to reboot the computer in order to use the xda2 at any resolution other that 16bit 44 or 48k  for me this is a major inconvenience after two frustrating days of trying to get the software issue resolved  ipacked it up and got a return authorization from amazon thank you again amazon for your amazing customer support

46079576_ROVALF6LD3VOP 2 good for first couple months
2112179_R1Y83CCYGRJ4F0 5 exlente
36871374_R21DKX3QTZM84 5 got it as a gift for a relative along with grado sr80e and a schiit modi dac simply put the synergy is incredible the extra warmth of the tube amp balances the slightly aggressive grado sound signature a little sweet to grados spicybr br you can swap tubes as well as opamps to fine tune the sound but i was very impressed with just the stock hardware the sr80ei combo was particularly suited to rock and jazz records the fuzziness of an electric guitar the sweetness of a trumpet this amp gives character and depth to every instrumentbr br just be sure to match your components well when you purchase an amp this amp with its swappable tubes and opamps can pair with just about any brand of headphone but moving up the grado scale with my grado rs1e which are 3x the cost of the little dot the amp was clearly out of its depth my elekit tu8200 is better suited for the high end headphone duties but for a secondarydesk system or a midfi headphone rig  i have not heard a better amp than the i especially given my preference for grados the next step up would be something like the millet minimax at twice the price amazing value
44373409_R1SKFKMXXP0RSU 5 these are phenomenal headphones hands down the best ive ever used theyre such high quality and have so many great features that even a nonaudiophile will notice the difference immediatelybr br id never had the opportunity to use any professionalquality headphones or speakers so id always figured the difference was so minimal that only diehard perfectionists would notice any improvement in the sound wow was i wrong they do a terrific job of cancelling background noise im noticing background instruments and effects ive never heard before in songs ive listened to for years which is not always good believe it or not some are downright distracting this is true across all genres of music though i find technoelectronica to be the biggest beneficiary of these headphones no surprises there obviously the quality of the base recording is the biggest factor here for instance i couldnt have told you before that apple provides higher quality mp3s than amazon does is it worth converting a whole library for this maybe any old favorites youve still got hanging around at 128 kps you might even find some new favorites  i certainly didbr br comfort is another big priority for me as someone who regularly gets headneck fatigue from headphones along with headaches and migraines from wearing them these in every way minimize my problems which is a pleasant surprise given their weight they took some getting used to i wont deny that i spent a whole month wearing them to give my honest opinion in this regard it didnt quite take that long to break them in but i can now wear them for hours without much of a problem i dont get headaches from wearing them which cant be said for any other headphones ive ever ownedbr br i was a bit suspect of their quality given their dj endorsement but theres no shoddy workmanship on these they definitely have a lot of weight to them but they feel solid and wellmade its a tight fit but the ear shells do a great job of distributing the pressure the headband is wrapped in leather for great cushioning and its light my averagesized ears just fit inside the ear cushions the unit comes packaged with from time to time ill feel some pinching nothing a quick readjustment doesnt fix anyone with largersmaller ears will probably want to swap the sizes my unit did not come with the other sizes the description says they are includedbr br if that wasnt reason enough to like these the list of cool features doesnt end there the ear shells can collapse and swivel for ease of transport without worrying theyll break wearing them oneeared is more handy that i thought given the surprising amount of noise reduction these headphones provide im not crazy about the coiled cable but ive warmed up to its benefits one thing that really helps it is that it can be plugged into either ear shell and rotated to lock in i love that they look fantastic too classy designbr br i have yet to find something i dislike about these headphones some people might argue the price is too high but if you could be assured of their extreme high quality comfort and added features is that not worth the cost id say it is highly recommendedhe ear shells do a great job of distributing the pressure the headband is wrapped in leather for great cushioning and its light my averagesized ears just fit inside the ear cushions the unit comes packaged with from time to time ill feel some pinching nothing a quick readjustment doesnt fix anyone with largersmaller ears will probably want to swap the sizes my unit did not come with the other sizes the description says they are includedbr br if that wasnt reason enough to like these the list of cool features doesnt end there the ear shells can collapse and swivel for ease of transport without worrying theyll break wearing them oneeared is more handy that i thought given the surprising amount of noise reduction these headphones provide im not crazy about the coiled cable but ive warmed up to its benefits one thing that really helps it is that it can be plugged into either ear shell and rotated to lock in i love that they look fantastic too classy designbr br i have yet to find something i dislike about these headphones some people might argue the price is too high but if you could be assured of their extreme high quality comfort and added features is that not worth the cost id say it is highly recommended

49221255_R2A1HJOY3NP4O4 5 the fit is perfect
51881757_RXSIN7S7KYSZC 4 very nice set of headphone good sound
113945_R1L24MDK15LMN0 5 these earphones get the job done and the customer service seems to be absolutely amazing however although the earphones do a good job of being soundproof it still has some major flaws the main headphone jack seems to be incredibly sensitive if you accidentally move the cord too much or you accidentally move or touch the headphone jack you either trigger siri cause the music to stop playing or cause it to play in fast speed although the earbuds themselves are amazing the flaws that are connected with its headphone jack are major enough for me to give it a 3 star review the sound quality is amazing and is comparable to that of the more expensive brands but if the music doesnt play smoothly and keeps annoyingly triggering siri every 5 seconds the entire experience isnt as enjoyable anymorebr however if you experience any problems with the earbuds the amazing customer service would gladly replace it for you relatively quicklybr br update i was pleasantly surprised after symphonized reached out to me concerning the review i put in before about siri and the weird flaw with the earphones they told me that i had a received an old version of their headphones one that wasnt compatible with the iphone 6 because apple changed the headphone jack for the iphone 6 they replaced my earphones and they work perfectly now no problems with siri or anything these earphones are now absolutely perfect and the amazing customer service that symphonized has makes these earphones way better
987247_R3OVRJH9KZG1O8 3 okay
17894199_R2LLLEH2WQMJ0U 1 the product has worked on and off since purchase and is no longer working at all
37726891_R391KY463TYETF 5 1st pair of ear buds that stay in my ear while running the rubber part is very soft and holds in place well without having to press hard and turn the ear piece
11949491_R537ADR4RNZNR 1 the left ear bud has stopped working after six months from the purchase exactly the same problem  happened to my previous order i really like this earbuds but to be honest with you i’m not sure if it’s worthwhile to keep on purchasing one after another every six month
987247_R3E0H0X18F6YOZ 4 goood man
15269428_RWNZT8DNCNI5U 2 bought my first pair on amazon on sale for 169 from an authorized apple dealer the sound quality is really good if you like low end tone not the in ears for brighthigher end rock music i like low end tone so the sound is good for me they are super comfortable with the flexible ear holder things and fit nicely into my ear the set up blue tooth is super easy too the problem is that after a day the remote failed i tried resetting the headphones and resting my iphone but it didnt work the remote just crapped out which kind of sucks when youre running and want to skip a song or lowerehigher the volume i exchanged them for another pair at apple after literally 3 hours the remote crapped out again i as really mad so i went back to the apple store the same day and exchanged them for another brand that was 99 wellthe remote worked the the sound quality of the other brand kind of sucked and they were really uncomfortable i decided that comfort fit and sound quality was more important than the remote so i exchanged them for another pair of powerbeats i was using them for a month and all was well i wouldve given the product 5 stars but today the remote failed and its not fixable if these were 99 i would say they are great but not for the current price i have a feeling they are going to stop working all together in a couple more months my last wired in ears lasted 3 years i will be happy if i get 2 years out of these they are obviously made in a cheap overseas factory dre is a money whore who doesnt care about quality attached to his name empty marketing
1446004_RN0Z4PYLLEDZ3 5 best earbuds seem better than my 25 earbuds  new input just sent these through the washer and dryer by accident and they still work perfectly fine
30830368_RVMFMONYMNRHV 5 easy to setup  sound great and extremely comfortable
12061025_R2PNSFY85J7ZWM 5 great pair of headphones with enough bass
809121_R1Q8NZO40TZ6RC 5 have these as well as the mdrzx100 these cost twice the amount with that being said cant really tell the difference between the two have only been playing the two thru andriod not unhappy just saying they sound alikeup date that was before i downloaded power boaster from play store now i can clearly hear the difference the mdrzx310wq play stronger with more base
506026_R75V75ZYRW183 4 they really good but overpriced thats why im giving them a four
3740161_R78B47LZ9GPIN 1 box come with one
13576516_R3121KV4MO0YX2 5 clear sound light weight good fit mic works good on calls highly visible color does not cancel out ambient sounds works with all 1834 stereo jack devices  what more could you ask
16623505_R3EL0R9OVJNOXY 5 easier to use than other memory radios compares with other radios of its size in am fm and sw reception battery life is good i especially like the ambient temperature display nice radio for its price
8315351_RQ56KMJ1CI25S 4 the cord could be longer
43885281_RIHMN29L7IG4A 3 cons somewhat tinny sound quality though sufficient for my purposes but it stopped working in less than two months  flaw point with the cable just above where it plugs in to the audio source  the two sides died separately but with each ear there was a week or two where i could still get sound if the cablewire was at precisely the right angleshapebr br pro headband was nicely flexible  comfortable to wear and stayed in place lightweight too i barely could tell i was wearing anything  easy to get on without fussing about earbud angles
52621087_R1FCZATZDNA216 4 id give them 5 stars for convenience and usability and four for the sound very good overall and excellent for a 40 set of wireless iems
32126752_R1SNV4VNR5SR4P 1 lousy sound and none of the combinations of sizing work in my ears
189241_R2JR0F1XOZBT7U 1 this headphone looks like great but there is no sound cancellation with that and sound cancellation is the most important feature with a headphone
33201316_R1EIA5FCTPURJY 5 they work great  be sure not to tie them to tight behind you head you will get connection issues and choppy music  once i adjusted the fold all worked
16065468_R1GPCCUV4F8KIZ 2 even after gentle  careful handling one of right bud lost sound after few weeks lose wiring problem
12421166_R2677KNJQ5IIKL 5 surprisingly great sound
14964107_R3J5XEDPPP8AY2 5 love these its great that they come with extra earbuds for different size ears the volume control works really well perfect for on an airplane
51454488_R1USJNZ4VN2F0I 5 excellent great sound quality
11158361_R1BHXV98OBA56C 3 nice
52200626_R54IVEVNEE5FF 2 broke very easily
24346487_R30ZSJSOA1YNTL 5 great headphones still working and they were a gift for my son last year
23170060_R2NK0ZWCPCJ3KL 1 ive had them for a few months now and theyre basically useless the audio jack for them is messed up i didnt do anything to it but it makes the music fade or pause even when you havent touched them they bring up siri at random and the whole thing is just a waste of my money youll get maybe 2 good months out of them
17040227_RT4HXDBNIETBT 4 audio is good for youtube videos  games etcbr holds a charge for a long time even on stand bybr great range for the homebr easy connection to my pcbr good constructionbr br bad things i found ear cups arent as large to go around my ears so they feel a little uncomfortable over long periods and the volume buttons is hard to find when wearing them i would not go out on public wearing them for the price i recommend  it for home use
19155397_R10TXLXFYWWUSB 5 work marvelously at the gym and work
4969342_R3MIS5OGK7JPX3 4 i got these for 26 from pinnacle deals with free shipping and no tax cant beat that for the level of noise canceling and comfort these have to offer they even have a mic i can use for gamingbr br 1 star because i wish the earcups had a little more depth they will be fine for most people but my left ear kind of sticks out which hurts after like 3 hours of use they honestly deserve a full 5 stars but i wanted to get my point across
4164647_RIAZHEK13Q4V 4 excellent for working out  good tone
690174_R2ZT1DQ19K2Z6U 4 first of all i am a big audio person i have test many headphones and i have to say they headphones are greatbr i cant say that it can parallel bose audio headsets but it is comparable to most others like sol republics sonysbr skullcandys and maybe beats the packaging is not the best but packaging does not dictate the headphone qualitybr the color on it looks great the set comes with two types of cords flat wmic and roundbr wo mic it also includes a converter to a bigger jack the cushions on the head phones are quite soft which make itbr very comfortable if i wear for 3 hours my ear tends to start hurting but i found out the reason was that headphonesbr kind of pushes my ear against my glasses so that pressure caused the discomfort the sound quality is great thebr construction is somewhat sturdy but the plastic used is kind of cheap it squeaks when you spread the headphones tobr put it on overall i think it is a great buy and the price make it better
1625981_RTKB08FJST786 5 was very satisfied34
50440673_R31STOJS270Z1A 4 for a compact set of headphones i think that these are a good value audio quality is more lifelike than what i get with a similar and drastically more expensive pair of bose nc phones the neutralization of ambient sound is not as good as with the bose phones but adequate to appreciate the difference in audio if i really want to cut down on ambient sound and get top tier music reproduction i use the etymotic research er4p earphones which block ambient noise mechanically with flanged rubber ear canal inserts they can be difficult to wear for a sixhour flight however to my experience the sennheiser pxc 250 ii phones give a great value for comfortable wear adequate noise cancellation and very good sound quality
1084059_R3HZKFH2IOUJ6I 5 great product just as described and delivered in the time offered
48576580_R6HAF490PGPOG 5 these are by far the best ear headphones i have purchased  more expensive than my usual headphone purchase but worth it
23915715_R3LG2K6LMBEJ0X 3 signal drops from time to time for reason otherwise they work fine

25759010_R32R4ZSW0LTOYD 4 great fit sound durability and controls only issue is the battery which doesnt seem to last very long usually after 6 hours of use
16096962_RDG95NG7T4U0L 5 very good headphone such that i bought a second pair for my son  service after the sale was outstanding  9 months after the sale one of the buttons were stuck inward  within 8 hrs of my email to bluedio i received an email back from them with a response that said that a new pair of headphones were on their way  great customer service and great headphones for my teenage kids  two thumbs up
12720770_R9823VVS2KYJE 5 it works great
10055810_R1TIVITFEC4BQB 4 on vacation tried a friends beats same as these and they were cool but i couldnt stomach the price found these and let me tell you amazing no complaints  sound is great they stay on and they paired easily  i havent run in them yet and that will be the ultimate test but i think they will be just great dont feel like they will come loose and did i say the sound is fantastic  at 12 my phones volume they are plenty loud  i cant wait to try these out in a busier environment because i used to have to spend a lot of time waiting at a loud place with lots of kids and other headphones never cut it  will love it if these do  for 12 the price of bts you cant beat thempun intended
522683_R3OXM7JLQS894C 1 awful
3014929_R3IT3GYFASLIK8 5 first off i love these headphones a few months back i borrowed a pair of bose qc25s from a friend and loved the noise canceling feature that was when i decided i wanted a pair with noise cancelation in the first place but i was put off by the high price tag on the bose so i began to look online for alternatives when i read reviews for the athanc9s people said that bose still beat out audiotechnica with noise canceling technology so i was worried that they wouldnt bring me the same satisfaction that the qc25s did but boy was i happy to be wrong other reviewers are right bose definitely still holds the edge on noise canceling tech but after owning them for a few weeks i actually prefer the athanc8s overall the noise cancelation is still fantastic maybe at 90 of what bose has in their qc25 but honestly the overall sound quality itself was significantly better on these headphones compared to the bosebr br if youre looking for a good pair of noise canceling headphones at a reasonable price with great sound quality these are the headphones for you
1694311_R2K9OAY9XRU7CQ 4 it is a bit expensive for a headphone case because it was not up to the standards of the headphones which were going in also the shipping took way longer than i expected ordered august 7th arrived august 26th point a was hungary point b was san francisco no tracking number in conclusion since this is the only case on the market for these headphones it is the best one out there
24297427_R1SY12YZ46LDNB 3 not as good as i hoped for 30 the bass is not as a good as cheaper pairs ive owned
51797297_R29AUAEWU4SHG7 5 these are the best ear buds ever in my opinion they shut out all but the loudest external noise and no one hears anything bleeding through as with so many other ear buds i have been unlucky enough to be near that huge company that has a lock on mp3s but calls them something with the letter i are the worst if those fruitnamed players are so great and they are so pricey cant they include ear buds that dont bleed sound i wish i could buy a boatload of these and pass them out when i hear the tinny noise emanating from other people making me listen to their noise nothing worse than hearing through someones headphones or ear buds when you arent wearing yours rant over   seriously these are great they fit perfectly and comfortably i wear them everyday at work where i listen to radio podcasts on my mp3 ive used these for music also and the sound is great no complaints whatsoever i am on my third pair but only because i have been so hard on them highly recommended for everyone who wants to use headphones or ear buds you wont be disappointed
34470076_R27G2HNRMII7K6 2 good sound but they dont stay in my ears
25190378_R1K0HOSAT3GXL2 5 great sounding comfortable over the ears pairs easily with bluetooth i would recommend them to others
49159432_R13S4ESQ39LWQL 5 love them i am glad that i was able to make them smaller for my daughter
1901942_R22YMMEMG5MGS 3 got this product for free to tryreview i really love how loud it gets and the easy connection to my phone only a 3 star because 1 the netting on 1 is not on properly and 2 the plastic bud falls off easily and the plastic hook behind it comes off with it its quite annoying it may very well be possible that i got a bad one because the rest of the item seems to be super well built
2526653_RX33BB7LVCUQY 5 love these headphones wouldnt want anything else after having them
52928308_R31CUGPID20IEV 5 these earbuds are great for listening to music audiobooks watching movies on your ipod or ipad  they are stereo and have a nice sound sample provided for review purposesbr br they have a few different ear tips so you can choose the ones that are most comfortable for youbr br they do not have a microphone so they are for listening only but are nice earbud and recommended
14076681_R2U03A53RD8PCV 3 id give these a 355 but im rounding down because enhanced bass is in the product name and the lack of bass is my biggest issue the mids and highs are solid probably a b and b grade respectively but the bass isnt as deep or prominent as id like id give the bass a cc on the whole its a bb when its mostly highs and lows but it gets absolutely drowned out by the mids when theres more than a couple things going on so the cx 300 iis are good for hiphop but definitely not recommended for rock and its variants i tried to eq it every which way switch mp3 players switch the rubber things but no matter what i do its just not working out i cant get a nice boom from rock music without turning the volume up to earshattering levelsbr br designwise theyre alright no issues here except the plug is kind of gigantic so it might get all bent up in your pocketbr br these phones compare unfavorably to the discontinued pioneer secl721k which are the best ive ever had never having spent above 60 the cx 300 ii frequency response is a relatively weak 42hz  17khz in comparison to the pioneers which are 5hz  23khz i didnt think it would be that big a difference to my nonaudiophile ears but it totally is im 100 sure theres better value out there for earphones under 50 bucks
29442147_R3S3ER9JM1LBQI 5 great coolerkinda small but great cooler
51928464_R3HN45D5BL1W4S 5 with a new set of ear cushions and this case which fits my vintage sony mdrv6s perfectly including the bulky coiled cord why do i need another pair  the sonys are excellent but a bit bulky for travel
107167_R2J3BG1NV3UN7 5 i am from méxico and i am very happy with my product everything was good so probably i will buy another thing very soonbr thank you for all
9926199_R3K5JW6RWCHKM6 4 these sound pretty goodand are quite light weightbut i didnt think the quality was that greatand for what it is i think they should be cheaper
44390293_R2U8RBQ1IQJX1 5 perfect replacement covers for my ancient radio shack headphones good quality fun color
24390181_R2T40A2K4W4T84 1 the think didnt even fit  if i can give i zero stars  that would be appropriate
44347062_R24AQ751P0K30M 3 the headphones didnt last i would have like for them to i liked them when they worked
37650924_R1MW703TRWBUSZ 1 it worked well for about a week then it wouldnt hold a charge for more than a minute once connected it automatically changed the default keyboard as well
2228650_RXAWU3RCNIAWA 5 price is pretty reasonable and the sound is pretty clear
13119703_R2FRX8HGVRZ5AM 2 these headphones do sound good4 starsbr br unfortunately the build quality is lacking the wiring is fragile and will go bad after 45 months of typical use this a 5 dollar headset masquerading as a 20 dollar set
551157_RMU9O6D4H8VPK 2 doesnt seem legitimate to memicrophone works fine but volume is noticeably low one of the ears also lost sound by the next week
8120940_R3JTZ1YMXD4B50 2 they arent that great one earphone went out for no apparent reason
45592321_R391A0PZ9LV0M4 5 there were a birthday present to my husband and he loves them
23651279_R26KQGS5VV8G5P 5 i decided to get some more robust closed back headphones after breaking my grados several times and closed back so i could use them outside my homebr br  i was expecting a dip in sound quality from the famed open backed grados but was suprised to find the sonys comparable or maybe even superior a little less clarity and sparkle on the highs not much a closed back headpiece can do to compete with open backed designs in that regard but everything else was as good or  better than sr60i in retrospect it shouldve been obvious that the sound quality would be great as these headphones are a studio standard among audio pros and have been for decadesbr br the build quality and durability of these headphones is unreal all metal hinges and hardware great cord etc i manhandle my headphones and travel with them to school and for domesticinternational trips ive used and abused these for almost a year now and they still look literally brand newbr br i never review things but felt compelled to because i havent been this happy with a product in a while
19239335_R1UDRJ6CI4BVQT 5 works great
33488771_R2KQRFF6PZQY0C 5 couldnt believe the good price for decent quality ear buds  also the choice of plugs allowed for a good fit in my ear  since all ear buds seem to last at most a couple of years i appreciate getting two packages so i have a replacement set ready to go
258906_R1CZ1U3TT8O431 1 the unit quit sending after 2 days
37418883_R2AHSOYQURZM5X 2 these are akward to wear  i bought them so i could listen while working around the house  cooking cleaning riding the exercycle etc  due to the design if i even bend over slightly they fall off and there is no way to adjust them  sound quality and ease of use is acceptable
41678927_R9G9O0VT5D7AP 1 only the left hand side of he headset works
6953937_R12MK47HAZGBFQ 3 poorly designed why the transmitter receives signal when plugged directly into a cable or satellite box and not directly into the television  unable to use when viewing blue ray movies as well
25585445_R1GH484OVUVEQD 3 price is good sound is only good for audio books not enough detail for listening to music minimal bassbr i have some music that has a good bass line from drums that is totally missing even my most cheap cell phone ear buds can produce enough bass to hear that it is there
14010840_R28NIHIZ4B5ZVR 1 very poor quality  1 out of the 3 didnt work at all
41461368_R2RBT9B7NR2KPR 5 great sound everything works great after weeks of use and still great
45848992_R3SB4MOB1ABELI 1 broke within a few months and sound on one side went out and so did mic very upset with this purchase
27876647_R2PH9R90FQYPFY 1 the cable picks up every little vibration and amplifies them into your ears save your money and buy something else
50171809_R16IAW33EM7SAN 5 look and work great
12464097_R3IW9DC6XFDUCB 4 great pair of over the hear in ear headphones for the price you pay for these headphones they sound great  great for working out or running if earbuds do not stay in your ears
23001381_R1ZUB8KAZQBHJ4 3 some what touchy adjustment but once set works well
8406317_R17TX4USVAAEI7 2 the power plug from the wall unit would not mate properly with the receptacle on the rear of the transmitter unitthe plug would not fully seat down in the receptacle a gap between the plug and receptacle was clearly evident the power light on the transmitter would not come on no matter how firmly we pressed on the yellow plug we tried twisting the plug while turning but it would not fully seat i am very disappointed in this product and its manufacturer as it appears that a quality check may  not have been made before the unit was shipped i have already shipped a previous similar item back because it was listed on a page with wireless items and it was not
23527743_R2JSY3WKXXF6HA 2 these are great when they feel like connecting but dont connect a lot of the time
121107_RXFERLANN2HK5 5 the best headphone i have ever found in this price sounds like my last headphone denon d2000 but with a even larger sound field than it wonderful experience
23059873_RB6X0MI7RENKO 4 im a very heavy sweater when i workout at the gym so i wanted something that can handle that ive gone through 2 different 34sweat proof34 headphones that have been ruined due to my heavy sweating ive used these twice and and tell they handle my sweating very well sound is also good although ive found that if too many apps are open and running they wont play as loud therefore ill close all apps and the earbuds will play loud as intended i discovered this on accident one day when i noticed they sounded softer than usual the only thing i dont like is that i feel i have to mess around to much to make sure they fit me properly i think its because my ears are smaller than most if it werent for that ive give them 5 stars overall i love these earbuds and certainly recommend
16996404_RQC6BI9TH7E1P 5 after going through 3 sets of powerbeats2 wireless headphones i finally found a pair that are not only comfortable but sound great and can handle my sweat
46705380_RLT6V9OIEDIRS 4 i ordered these for our daughters ipad and it fits fine in her ears the quality is good and the glow in the dark is noticeable well worth the price
44221402_R11OA413JTAWMI 5 great sound

51257881_R3N3T6NW5TEQUM 4 good
41634392_RYM1PTHRZNTTU 2 goes into ear canal too far uncomfortable
41886623_R1HE97PYBFWZ5S 4 fits my headphone almost perfect  happy with the purchase
30528768_R2DM1PYQ1OXX8C 5 it does not eliminates aircraft noise totally but definitely removes at least more then 75 airplane noisebr i wish it had programmable usb port so i could select what frequencies i would like to remove
5674737_R2V4PQNEW88WMG 5 decided to buy these after days of searching for some good bluetooth headset delivery was quick the bass is amazing if your like me and like youre music thumping

35250842_RFQBLV0NTICCG 5 bought these for my mom after she came down with muscle weakness from illness which made it difficult to hold her cell to her ear for any extended period of time lets just say with this shes on the phone just like before chatting it upbr she loves how comfy the earbuds are  how clear the sound
110142_R39YD7FK9C8UL2 5 one of the if not the best earbuds ive had for the price i love these more than my apple earbuds honestly im very pleased with these d
15240695_R3CKG39P1RL4L1 5 great sounding headset  i was surprised by the sound of these headphones  they came in a nice cardboard box are easy to use and have a spare set of sponge earphone covers  i have been using them a few weeks now and consider these a terrific deal  i wear them walking the dog working out and when i am doing data entry at work and dont want people bothering me  one charge lasts for quite a while  go ahead order a set
345552_R1FTXN8LZKP3O 3 durable
1266048_R27TRZK0C0QY39 5 oh yes
15000515_R193KZUJF1J027 5 expensive but worth every penny wonderful headsets these are 34open34 headsets as opposed to the 175s which are closed research which is best for your application with the 34open34 type someone sitting nearby will hear what you are listening to if not wearing a set themselves
44201915_R32DQIYBI1W3LD 5 very nice meets our needs
14299829_R14IRNBU0CFBPH 5 nice headphones  great value

29293105_R3BWJ0GEK7NKJP 4 although i am not a professional dj from time to time my husband and i do some studio work that requires a good pair of headphones i personally found these to be too heavy for my liking not to mention kind of large for my ears so i asked my husband to evaluate them he was happy to try these out and after having spent several weeks with them shared his overall impressions with me which i am passing along his thoughtsbr br size and build qualitybr br these headphones are fairly ruggedly made they are a little on the heavy side just under a pound with the cable but they offer a well padded headband and comfortable ear cushions they fit snugly for good sound isolation the cable is detachable and can be connected to either driver depending on which side you prefer the cable connection is unique the angled connector is keyed at the plug and needs to be inserted with the cable perpendicular to the driver body in order to lock it inbr br two things worth noting 1 the cable is a little over 50” long and with the coiled section and extends to about 8’ rather than the 15’ that they claim in the specs  2 in the product description it says that these come with three different sized ear cushions they do not they come with one medium sized pair of ear cushionsbr br i do feel given the price that philips should have included all three sizes of cushions as advertised  they can be purchased in a smaller or larger size according to the manual and website but run between 3546 a pair depending on the size the ability to isolate sound depends on the fit of the ear cushions and is an important feature if you purchase these and they dont fit properly it could be an issue an issue that could have been avoided by having more than one size cushion to choose from and for some people this one small detail could be a deal breakerbr br soundbr br i have tested these headphones with all types of music i listened critically to rock jazz rb classical piano guitar bass and vocals i set up my listening device at a flat level so the sound would not be colored by any equalization in my opinion they have a well balanced sound that doesn’t accentuate any one range over the other you can hear the timbre of the instruments with excellent sound reproduction sounds are crystal clear and free of distortion these headphones are not bass heavy and i am personally happy about that should you desire more bass you can crank it up using an equalizerbr br other considerationsbr br the price is a bit of a sticking point for me i ask myself 34would i spend almost 400 retail on these headphones34 as a home studio musician or more casual listener im not certain that i could justify the price dont get me wrong the sound quality is excellent but i have several older pairs of professional headphones that i actually prefer over these in terms of overall design and comfortbr br i really do enjoy the way that these reproduce sound but when all is said and done i have not been able to fall in love with the current price tagd vocals i set up my listening device at a flat level so the sound would not be colored by any equalization in my opinion they have a well balanced sound that doesn’t accentuate any one range over the other you can hear the timbre of the instruments with excellent sound reproduction sounds are crystal clear and free of distortion these headphones are not bass heavy and i am personally happy about that should you desire more bass you can crank it up using an equalizer  other considerations  the price is a bit of a sticking point for me i ask myself 34would i spend almost 400 retail on these headphones34 as a home studio musician or more casual listener im not certain that i could justify the price dont get me wrong the sound quality is excellent but i have several older pairs of professional headphones that i actually prefer over these in terms of overall design and comfort  i really do enjoy the way that these reproduce sound but when all is said and done i have not been able to fall in love with the current price tag
45366919_R3OVEJEVFNZBV7 4 i have been using etymotic earphones practically since the arrival of the ipod the apple white buds tend to hurt my ears after an hour or so my first pair was purchased at an apple storethe sound is quite good for someone who fancies himself as an audiophile i have the much ballyhooed and celebrated 34beats earphones34 which are a little cumbersome to place correctly on your ear and most of all just too bass heavy i like my music eqd with more treble where the piano tickles brightly the high hat shimmers and the instrumentation is bright and sparkling the downside of the etymotic which indeed offers a more treble eq is having to constantly replace the filters about every 6 months that becomes a tad costly 15 a set and laborious i would have thought that etymotic would have found a much more user friendly solution by now
11334936_R226UN196JC253 1 one of the earbuds stopped working on the second day of use and the craftsmanship is visibly poor with small chips around the seams and the earbuds themselves protrude out of your ears to the point where you cant lay down on them without having the earbuds shoved into your ear canal overall these are very poor quality headphones even for the price there are much better 10 headphones on amazon
53071068_R2YQN0CPP7TULD 5 13yrold granddaughter loves her buds
34459973_R25N5KMSGEYDS7 5 i bought these headphones to be able to watch tv shows in the same room as my husband when hes working and can be distracted by the tv sound our tv is outdoors and gets signal from a cable box inside the house using wireless hdmi  about 30ft away from where we sit and through the exterior cement wall of the house after reading some other reviews i was worried the sound quality would be poor and that id have to return them but the sound quality is great and the lipvoice sync is better than with the wireless hdmi hookup the setup of the headphones was very easy  less than 5 minutes to get the batteries in and connect the base to the cable box indoors overall im very happy with them
51213319_R2CFSROECQ92PW 1 after seeing the price of these and reading the reviews i thought they sounded too good to be true  turns out i was right  received the headphones and tried to charge them  plugged them into the computer to charge first via the usb charging cable  nothing happened no red light to indicate they were charging  tried two different power outlets with the same result  left them plugged in for a little while to see if it was just the red light that wasnt working but they never charged  im returning them and looking for another alternative
23257557_RITVNUXNUN8IP 5 excelents earphones
2581661_R299RBSUNNZY8K 5 had to replace a pair of these after my dog chewed them up these headphones are not dog proof that being said they are great headphones and i use them almost every day at the gym never had any problems with them
47738169_RTMML1MW735AP 4 works as advertised
12154264_R2X5EP1XSOIZ0A 5 i bought these for my mother who was turning the volume on the tv so high no one wanted to watch with her  now she can here and we can all enjoy our favorite shows to gether again  thanks

10329386_RBWVKF95UGHWJ 5 these headphones sound amazing i listen to mostly rock and metal music so if you like bands such as deftones breaking benjamin blessthefall silverstein all that remains a day to remember then youll love these ive been messing around with the sound equalizer on both my laptop and my phone with these connected and they sound phenomenal with everything  i bought the refurbished ones from vmoda direct and i couldnt even tell they were refurbished and completely forgot all about it until i logged on to leave a comment
51487691_R2H48748UBY26P 5 these fit my needs perfectly the ear buds fit well in my smaller ears and they are comfortable the cord does not get tangled which is my favorite feature  great value for the price
37514061_RKSO5ZEL7LSQY 1 i previously bought earbuds similar to these jvc hafx1x and i loved them they lasted me over 2 years and they were amazing these earbuds on the other hand lasted me a couple days of very minor use minor as in walking with my mp3 player in my pocket while i mow the lawn light the right earbuds sound now cuts in and out and takes a little wiggling to get sound from both buds ive had this problem from your typical storebought 6 dollar earbuds but after a couple months of usebr br i will be returning these as soon as i get the chance possibly get a replacement as i really do like how it sounds and fit in my ear as of now 1 star
43059918_R13RGCK6KS7JC3 5 bought these for y husband several years ago and they still work perfectly  read all the reviews on head phones and this one rated high and did not disappoint he watches tv is front room and i watch in family room works for us and i cannot hear his tv
47783733_R18DQYISIREC9M 5 works as expected arrived on time  great condition on packaging sound qualitys pretty good  you get what you pay for i really like them so far
11417174_R2D80F23J1PI8R 2 the little padded ear muff things fall off easily and get lost  the sound is okay when it works but are kind of finicky  overall am disappointed in this product  bought 4 pairs for my kids to use in the car and none were in working order within 6 months
17595227_R37TDCI38RVCFU 1 bought for my husband to use with hdtv and it was not adaptable for our set
18363353_RMW92IWYGR78E 5 great product good music quality stays in place
38747083_R20T5UBA7D3KZL 5 i have always had a problem getting ear buds to stay in my ears so when i came across these i figured id give them a try since they have the hooks that over the top and behind your ear when i first put them on after i received them they felt comfortable in my ear i did my 34jumping jack test34 to see if they stayed inon my ears and they didbr br i used them for the first time at the gym this morning where i ran about two miles and did ten minutes on a stair master machine as you can imagine i was pretty sweaty at the end of my workout throughout the entire workout they did not once fall or slip out of my ears oncr i didnt have to blare my music to cancel out all the external noise eitherbr br overall  id say for the price considering some wireless headphonesear buds are going for 100 this is a great dealbr br since ive only uses them once i will update if i have any issues in the future
30979123_R1VCQRKMU86PHM 5 superb sound a pricey but a perfect headphone for music lovers
19617818_R2Q67O9E7Z6YGG 5 works great  bought these for traveling on plane for my 2 now 3 yo daughter with her nabi 2  they work great and have survived 5 round trips and counting
22018886_R218R57T5MBUAI 5 i enjoy using my jvc harx300 fullsize headphones  they are comfortable  the sound is great  they are durable  i have been using them regularly for months without any issues  i even allow my children to borrow them and the headphones are still in one piece and functioning as they should  as a note not a criticism  the headphones do adjust to fit different sized heads but even on the smallest setting they slide off of my childrens heads
48002549_R24RN7OZB3BPJH 2 right headphone stopped working after approximately 3 weeks of use followed a week later by the left headphone strangely none of the earbud attachments seemed to fit nicely in my ear they were either falling out or too tight generally i do not have this problem with earbuds i had high hopes for these but unfortunately they barely lasted a month
38837239_R33MIXZTHUEITE 4 the handle on the zipper sometimes are twisted to the side so it takes some fiddling and work to get it straight again so i can actually open and use it at those times it takes just as long to get this one out and ready as any other tangled headphones

31365793_R1ZZ502J2KG2GJ 2 91216 updatebr to put a bow on this review i eventually did get a refund for the headphones and sol was kind enough to send me a free pair of headphones for my troublesbr br in my initial review i had forgot to mention that sol doublecharged me which was also part of the frustrating customer service experiencebr br because of sols making amends ive added another star but will still be leary of buying directly from sol going forwardbr br br 1020 updatebr so 13 days after sol republic received my return i am just now getting a refund this is after basically calling sol every other day asking about the status of my refund and i had to call from a different phone number because for some reason i could never get through to a customer service agent when using my phone sometimes even getting sent straight to voicemailbr br bottom line if you buy this do not buy directly from sol republicbr br 1015 updatebr sol republic’s customer service is the worst my return was received by sol on october 8th and a week later i still haven’t received my refund or any kind of notification that it is coming soonbr br i then call sol’s customer support who say they will call back me back soon with more details flashforward 2 hours still no call so i sit on hold for 10 minutes and get kicked off then again for 5 minutes still nothingbr br so i dial 67 then sol’s customer support  and then miraculously they answer my call what good fortunebr br so to recap sol’s poor customer service it took them over 24 hours to email me back then they didn’t refund me and then they were obviously screening and not answering my calls just amazingly poor customer supportbr br br 930 updatebr br so i gave these another shot – more or less the same experience but this time i used them at my office job it just wasn’t very practical to have one earbud in and the other just hanging down the front of my dress shirt and they didn’t stay on great – they would nearly slide off at times since they didn’t have a good grip due to the fact that the headphones weren’t resting on my neck skin but on my dress shirtbr br also i didn’t have a great experience with sol republic’s customer support this time i bought from their website due to coupon code i emailed customer support inquiring about their return process and i still haven’t received a response as of 24 hours later i then called customer support and they said they would email me a rma form so i could ship my return but as of 1 hour later i haven’t received any email from sol republic customer support i guess i need to call them againbr br i think these headphones are great for when you are able to have both earbuds in while wearing a tshirtpolo shirtunbuttoned dress shirt but they just aren’t practical for a corporate office settingbr br br br really enjoyed this bluetooth earbuds definitely more comfortable and blends in better than lgs tone infinim but really wish they included retractable earbuds like lgsbr br tried to use these while biking and experienced a lot of 34skipping34 audio despite my iphone less than a foot away strapped on my arm had trouble with earbuds staying in too while bikingbr br summary great bluetooth earbuds but wouldnt recommend for gymexercise useearbud in and the other just hanging down the front of my dress shirt and they didn’t stay on great – they would nearly slide off at times since they didn’t have a good grip due to the fact that the headphones weren’t resting on my neck skin but on my dress shirtbr br also i didn’t have a great experience with sol republic’s customer support this time i bought from their website due to coupon code i emailed customer support inquiring about their return process and i still haven’t received a response as of 24 hours later i then called customer support and they said they would email me a rma form so i could ship my return but as of 1 hour later i haven’t received any email from sol republic customer support i guess i need to call them againbr br i think these headphones are great for when you are able to have both earbuds in while wearing a tshirtpolo shirtunbuttoned dress shirt but they just aren’t practical for a corporate office settingbr br br br really enjoyed this bluetooth earbuds definitely more comfortable and blends in better than lgs tone infinim but really wish they included retractable earbuds like lgsbr br tried to use these while biking and experienced a lot of 34skipping34 audio despite my iphone less than a foot away strapped on my arm had trouble with earbuds staying in too while bikingbr br summary great bluetooth earbuds but wouldnt recommend for gymexercise use
29979210_R366D1GLTH2JPB 3 functional  i have some of the old style ear buds  i dont want to throw them away but they are uncomfortable without pads and these pads have limited wear
10236157_R28VGFJ2DOR0RF 5 i bought this item 2 months ago im very satisfied of using them
24070209_RCTHE164OK7CB 1 plastic support for earphone broke after 2 months of use  the technology is good sound is good  but the plastic is fragile and will break apart  i dont recommend it
35286825_R8PEI2WJXGJKY 5 probably the best earbuds ive ever had theyre very comfortable and stay put durable materials and the connections seem sturdy the sound quality is on par with the large bulky sennheisers i have only thing is they might have too much bass for my setup i had to make some minor eq adjustments  i suppose that could be a matter of preference i dont always like having a lot of extra low end going
41461368_R1DXXQX6CT8WZI 5 great for b00nwxsuvi sentey® headphone headset flow blackred and b00siyejy8 intone i65 headphones with microphonestereo headset with inline volume controlbr this case is pretty much a 34one for all34 of this type headsets if you feel that the headset wont fit for a little bit the case will stretch a little bit and still keep everything inside protected because the materials used to do this are of very high qualitybr i could also say that this item is thick enough to give a lot of protection and flexible enough so when you carry it around is very comfortablebr the outside surface is also very nice feel at touch
1782983_R3455NCYUDKLDM 1 crap product dont buy
41331952_R1IPFKZJCDDH3T 4 arrived within days pleased with super fast shipping i love that it has cushions on head piece and ear pieces are super soft my toddler was super excited to wear them  the volume control switch is a little off centered but still functions properly i really expected the volume to be lower than it is i can hear it when my toddler is wearing it luckily they dont like the volume loud and that can truly be controlled the only real concern that i have is the cord it is extremely long and can see it as a tripping hazard or getting tangle upim looking into fixing thatbr overall we are very pleased and would recommend and purchase again if need be
19828048_R1KI4BAQL3MDGJ 5 amazing sound great fit
44145804_R28XC1JH4BRICJ 5 like magical clouds engulfing your head i got these for my atm50x man it changed thebr comfort drastically but reduced the base by about 2db or so worth it for sure
38522532_R3DWQQFMCSER3J 3 very good sound but the bottom part if youre not careful the wires break and there goes the soundtypical problem with these items
3419495_R3BJA48BWUUWIH 2 sound is great the fit isnt quite good they are too big and running in hard ground they move on the ear after one week of use they stop turning on i needed half hour to get them on next time i tryed for more than a hour now i just dont let them turn off always on charge and go they have less than a month of use and im a bit desapointed if they work fine neertheless i hould be happy but if im in trouble to to turn them on
48603994_R2Z1AS6MW31JF8 5 this little devicegadget is very useful and worth every penny

33732165_R1F8EYIF7VQ18N 5 love these headphones but the packaging deserves 1 star they make these impossible to open with a sharp knife
10607966_R1CUVDFIUBGUJ1 1 this did not last very long i dont know why i have had less expensive mp3 players before but this one crapped out pretty early i have moved away from these and just tried to get a better brand
27694189_R3QUSHJC7UTMKC 2 updatebr easy to set up  hooked to tv so volume no longer bothers wife  things were great for a while  this is the second pair of rs120 i have had  both pair developed severe static problems  when the volume or tuning wheels were touched or pressed or tapped the static would disappear temporarily the headphones seem to last about two years which is the warranty period
42551435_R2KNTW1E146U7G 1 bought these earbuds because i have had otto in the past  when they arrived the left earbud was not crimped correctly and the sound in the right earbud was horrible  very disappointed
30142299_R3J99NRITCY8D9 5 great amp  works really well with the e07k
16601416_RU81YZHVXWZN8 5 very nice sound quality is great i would highly recommend this product 
14662369_R2GTFKDETAABET 5 really great headphones i wear mine to the gym great sound and quality
32645655_R2EHFN59R3OJ8Z 5 works great in the car for my 2009 traverse entertainment system fits great on my 4 year old my 6 year old and the adults who have used them
662395_R138R40PBOR36N 2 the quality is good but you have to resync these headphones every 30 seconds as they end up with at least six seconds delay
111919_R149HSY9DXJVID 5 really good for the price for a starter earphones its really good
42403013_R35OW060OOPQY9 5 great
12527457_R1YKDX16NCVPIU 5 lightweight confortable  they sound great not much more to be said
6853877_R3CXTQT4ZZ33SO 5 excellent headphones especially with apple devices
11401048_R1F2Y8QMHOLZVZ 4 i like the sound and that i can be wireless but there is no adjustment on the width and after about twenty minutes it becomes annoying
26058426_RVVXZ27UGODCE 5 exactly what we needed  not expensive great for a long road trip with 2 seven year old boys
14912750_R2JJZJM88O2FXH 1 these ear phones looked authentic all the way down to the last detail but were not i instantly could feel the difference in the materials used and by the way these earbuds would not stay in my ears as every other set of authentic apple earphones has do not purchase these knockoffs pay 10 for an authentic pair from apple you can fake the outside but the inside you cant the sound of these are awful out of the box also another sign they are fake
8277338_R34ZVZUWJ7CJU3 4 all good
8517123_R10O1U3QJGT3R 3 since apple purchased beats the ear pads have become much cheaper and harder on the ears
11848880_R1IQKF6HCD09IK 2 these just arent worth more than 50theyre just average in all aspectsthey would be ok for people just looking for earbudsbut i can run off about 1015 earbuds that have better sonically qualitybr br my history i have owned everything frombr logitech ultimate ears 700br thinksound ms01br thinksound rainbr shure se215br r50br clarityone eb110br yamaha eph100slbr yamaha ephm200br bose ie2br audiotechnica athcks77bkbr vsonic gr07 mk2br ttpod t1ebr audio technica athim70br brainwavz s5br ttpod t2 3driver hybrid 2badynamic hybrid drivebr jbl synchros 200br dunu dn 2000br dunu dn 1000these are my favbr meelectronics mduo dual dynamicbr sony xbah3br rha ma750ibr jvc hafxz200br mtx ix2br br yes i owned all of theseneed opinion ask awaybr next on the agendafidue a73 and the the a83br br i have played all genres various recording quality levelsmy sony dac computer and stereo

28709796_R3LKO9H4TDLRBJ 5 use them at the gym  my wife says my eyeballs sweat when i work out but these stayed in place and the sound is great
1129953_R23AH20PB7U9RJ 1 not comfy and very large
208796_RQQQHEEP073QR 5 they sound great better than beats
7464781_R2GQIALZSDL828 4 i got these to replace my last pair of earbuds that were broken  durablitiy is usually an issue but the included carrying pouch along with the excellent build quality has kept this pair working and looking great  the sound quality is good for a pair of inears albiet possibly a bit muddy in the low end
40552857_RPEYS79MJPARH 5 most comfortable earbuds ive ever used  its great to have replacement 34memory foam34 earbud 34tips34
40504413_R3PWTHUV8VO6B8 4 love the quality but the cord could have been a little longer
6613276_R3GP913AALFETO 2 it was ok brok 2 weeks after i bought it some cables inside the speaker
14246745_R15Y9LIXVDEF20 3 they are lovely but when i connect them to my iphone it starts siri up and pauses the music out of freaking nowhere
43853766_R16IHU0VO1VWK6 5 works great
34836194_R292XQPDIJ5T7H 5 i realized tonight that i have been using the same ear buds for my mp3 player when i listen to music in bed for well over 2 years now  considering i like to rest on my side sometimes with them in these are also by far the most comfortable ear buds ive found for that purpose after having tried about a half dozen  im extremely pleased with these far more so than with most items i buy  so much so that im coming on here to review them 25 years after buying them just because i realized how great theyve been  im even considering buying another pair just to have a backup ready when they eventually do have a problem
15372570_R31420RNF288D4 4 the headphones dont work very well and they dont stay in my ears  but hey  you are listening to a headphone while swimming  pretty great
5005931_R1D2PD6YH8LYNM 3 i bought this headphone for my daughter but she doesnt like it
33631166_R22NWYAFOM6LFG 5 great gift love it
9579072_R2LZ9E3YV7XZ8B 5 bought for my daughter she a a little rough on these they still work 2 years later
1153762_R61068PX8MVHP 1 not legit apple dont buy this peoce of crap
1338462_R3RDAVU2SO9EUC 4 good product at a good price
2168191_R2VGSPXXO8GX11 5 doesnt completely isolate noise but for the price its worth it i had a pair that lasted me over a year but i lost them so i had to purchase a new pair this product lasts long can handle wear and tear and works great with any type of music
11831345_R2XXT8SGIC38NA 1 httpwwwamazoncomgpproductb0001ftvekredirecttruerefcmcrrypprdttlsol0br good sound for surebr however the cord from the base to plugin has totally disintegrated  little pieces of cheap plastic all the way down the cord to bare wire to repair they need to be rewired  i called sennheiser and there is no recourse  you must pay to send to them pay them to repair cord pay then for return shipping  they do not stand behind their product very disappointing and expensivebr would never buy their product again
51628455_R36GUCHLV5IUQ0 2 felt i had to write a review here because of my experience with this company i am an avid athlete and exercise six days a week i bought these headphones to wear during runs and gym workouts they are great lightweight and stay put on your ears and head the bonus to these was the mesh headphone covers that you can remove and wash when they get soaked with sweat well the first time i washed them and tried to put them back on both pads tore still wearable but i felt i wanted to replace them i wrote the company and got an email back asking for all my info a copy of the sales receipt etc i emailed back and said i simply wanted to purchase replacement pads they then emailed me back for my info to 34put me on a list with other customers when i responded saying again that i simply wanted to purchase some replacements they responded by saying that i would be put on a list and when they were available i would be notified repeatedly i asked for a telephone number for customer service but was never given one i am now stuck with these ripped pads and have no idea when or if i will get a response be wary of companies that do not have customer service phone contacts such a drag because as i said really solid headphones
6531377_R2VFPCQXTRGMAN 5 these headphones are so comfortable  i bought them for an online spanish class but i will be using them for everything
53012317_R1NJBLCE8HV8R9 5 sleek affordable and well delivered quickly
20804110_R12KCN3MEKWA2U 5 amazing entry level 34audiophile34 headphones theres tons of reviews everywhere they all say the same thing these provide amazing value if you like listening to different types of music classical edm hip hoprap etc and appreciate clarity while blocking out outside noise then these are for you when available for 5060 its a nobrainer i use these for studying all the time cant go wrong
27637125_R1QFEOWMT24EFV 4 for the low price paid it is a good product
43217014_R1E81RQ2AR0WNO 5 nice earbuds for the price
27933753_R2G64PYDVT3VRB 1 i thought this would be the best gift and it was until the person went to use them and they didnt work at all not a sound at all
10609844_R3J1ZLX4PTMEZU 1 i used to believe it is a great product but it is not working well after seven weeks of use
13973682_R1YI4SXAAZCWB2 1 the product i receive was defective and know i have to go the apple store and try to replace it this is suppose to be a new product and all the pieces are falling apartbr br  worse experience ever

12323593_R1SSWMKCGRKCN1 2 awesome
28291355_R34LKWJ5PK61L9 5 so far hands down these are the best bluetooth earbuds i have bought i have gone through dozens of headphones and earbuds were they either fall apart to quick or the sweat destroys them i have used these for running martial arts and weight lifting and they have worked terrific the sound is incredibly and the phone feature picks up everything your saying loud and clear if you are looking for a pair of earbuds then look no further
1619706_R2QWSD9STF1JOM 2 not as my expectation
4040769_R13Z7OQIORZL1C 2 device connected quickly but sound quality was poor
7061972_RVVZRIZBRLGUA 3 this is beautiful headphones on sale for this moment and  i know why  sound is good but i throw 2 of 3 cords  i had in set in the trash after 2 months using  too tight cannot wear long enough i will never buy this headphones even for a 50 cause are extremely tough
12327723_RVQDRIW2SUX04 2 the controls are really hard to feel or operate  instructions are difficult to read they are really printed in super light ink
6363234_R2S87Q1O92DDVO 5 its very good and comfortable headphones

44621030_R2CSBIIMSSXBPE 5 i game a lot with a pair of senheisser pc333ds  the only issue is even after owning it for a while the pc333ds really hurt to wear for a few hours while gaming  so thus i wanted to look for something that sounded just as good as the senheisser but also was comfortable as the hyperx cloud gaming headset that i also ownbr br the vmoda quite frankly hit all the requirements and more  these as of august 2015 are the best headsets ive ever bought in my life sound wise  i am so impressed by the way these sound and feel  they are superbly comfortable and im truly hearing details and sounds that i havent heard beforebr br i currently still have a set of audio technica athm50s the senheisser pc333d the hyperx cloud ii some asus 50 gaming headset and the vmoda  going through and listening the same tracks on each one the clear stand out quality wise is time and time again the vmoda  it seems like any of the other headsets werent ever better it was always just trying to get just as good  the vmoda was consistently the most pleasing headset to use for gaming music netflixhbogo viewing and morebr br i will say though im not an audiophile  i just game a lot and listen to a lot of music while editing photos  so this review is written by a simple guy who likes headphones
14772935_R27B7E5X89EZL8 3 okay
15023720_R1XLD2HANFFIBY 2 i liked the headphones and then one ear completely stopped working after 2 months of use very random occurrence happened out of no where
24043302_RZWD2EK68O7C8 1 these headphones are inferior to say the least  the sound is tinty with little bass quality and after only a few uses a short has developed and only one side of the headphones work  i plan to return them asap
29029743_R1EFWQ8LI998W5 2 uncomfortable dont last long
4796745_R2MSFN0DGRZUG6 5 very nice headphones i dont like its look so much but they work very well they are the most comfortable i have ever used and the sound is powerfull and clear i use them with a digital piano and are the best i have tried
1273237_RNY1IE4019BRC 4 work great only issue is that sometimes i accidentally push the middle button when trying to change the volume and all of a sudden my phone is making a call to the last person i talked to i have not checked the manual to see if this is how it is supposed to work but i would rather the first click of the middle button be a simple pause
15255537_R18WL2Y8KT8T5L 5 these ear wraps are my favorite when it comes to working out most earbuds have dangly wires that get in the way but this one has a clip that holds the wires in place the pop of neon also adds a nice touch to my sportswear
49430658_R2F4HNPWBJP2BZ 5 the headphones were in terrific shape and came with all parts as specified  the sound quality is excellent and they work for the full range of my activities from sitting at my desk to trucking around the house doing chores to working out  super comfortable to boot  a great deal considering the price  shipped promptly as specified  i tend to be hard on headphones and end up replacing them about every 46 months  with deals like this i can afford better quality on that schedule
8009725_R1CK3ESWIKYTYJ 5 bought this after being very upset with my replacement fiio cable this one is not microphonic the cable is flexible enough to be wrapped around the ears without a memory wire and i like it better this way without the memory wire there is no 34hook34 to get tangled with and you have the option to wear without wrapping around the ears but i do not like wearing it this waybr br overall i like this better than the stock cable it is shorter better for portability it is less likely to become tangled because of no memory wire and it is much lighter and harder to notice you are wearing headphones seriously it is soo light
1990651_R1BKMH3UINPXBB 4 monoprice hifi over the ear review table of contents br br 1 introbr 2 packagingbr 3 build qualitybr 4 comfortbr 5 sound before and after burn inbr 6 40 hours of music  gamingbr 7 pros  consbr 8 conclusionbr br intro br monoprice provided the hifi over the ear headphones free for review purposesbr when i received the headphones and after unboxing them i did a 2 hour comfort test in which i wear the headphones without listening to anything for 2 hours after this i proceeded to listen to music for 4hours followed with overnight burn in with pink noise then another 4 hours of listening to music  the following week after receiving the headphones i wore them listening to music movies or playing video games for approximately 10 hours a day  during this review i will cover the packaging build quality comfort and sound before and after the burn in discuss my experience with over 50 hours of audio pros and cons and last but not least my conclusion so let’s get startedbr br packagingbr the outside of the box shows an actual size photo of the headphones the art isnt too aggressive and highlights key features with emphasis on hifi opening the box you fix you find a plastic shell holding a hard case with the headphones inside of it no paper work included i was pleasantly surprised that the headphones were in their own hard case which has a good quality feel to it opening the zipper to reveal the headphones and cablebr br build qualitybr the headphones are built really well and feel sturdy the majority of this headphone is covered with soft touch rubberized plastic with chrome accents at the swivels the ear pads are extremely nice and feel like they are constructed with memory foam the ear pads can be easily removed to reveal the 40mm speakers the build quality of the headphones has a slight plastic feel but they do not feel fragile or cheapbr br comfortbr first thing i did when i received these headphones is put them on and wear them for up to 2 hours without listening to anything i do this so that im not distracted by what im listening to and can determine the comfort of the headphones  i was able to wear these headphones for 2 hours without any discomfort the following 5 days these were so comfortable i wore them for at least 10 hours a day for my music movies playing video games and making phone calls i do have smaller than average ears and found the ear pads barely fit right around them however i had my wife test the fit and she said parts of the ear pads sit on her ear nonetheless these are very comfortable and everyone i had try the headphones on agreed they were incredibly comfortable the one downside i had with the ear pads aside from being a little on the small side is possibly a personal problem i tend to overheat easily therefore the leather ear pads would stick to my skin  as long as i stayed cool i didnt have any issues with the ear padsbr br sound before  after burn inbr i listened to a wide range of music which includes rap classical pop and country for 4 hours before letting the headphones play pink noise at nearly full volume overnight  the first 4 hours listening the headphones had a wide sound stage with very clear bright almost shrill highs the midrange is not muddy but the bass seemed to not have punch at times after doing the overnight burn in i listened to the same arrangement of music again for 4 hours i noticed a small change with the highs they werent as shrill and the midrange seemed a little warmer though the bass was full it didnt however have a deep kick with some genres the clarity and range of these headphones is remarkable when listening to certain music you can hear clear separation of instruments arrangements and in some instances they allowed me to hear audio that some of my other headphones didnt pick up  overnight burn in with pink noise helped mellow these headphones out on the highsbr br 40 hours of music and gamingbr the sound isolation is remarkable with these headphone i was able to test the sound isolation during my wife’s first 2 days of college the college had a dj playing music loudly in the cafeteria putting these headphones on blocked out the majority of the music being played by the dj  i listened to my music without any intrusion of the other music being played around mebr i wanted to make sure i got a good amount of time wearing these headphones for all types of listening activity to provide the best review i could  the music i listened varied from les miserables phantom of the opera to 50 cent eminem all the way to pop and country  the listening experience was more than enjoyable as i found myself not missing my more expensive headphones i have available  gaming with these headphones i played battlefield 4 brawlhalla guild wars 2 and a few others the headphones provided a great open sound stage which allowed me to accurately pin point audio within games and hunt down my opponents  making a phone call with the headphones using the build in mic on the cable my voice came through clearly  the cable has plus minus pause and play buttons the pause play button do as intended and if you double tap that button it also forwards to the next track  this was very nice when i didnt want to reach for the devicebr br pros and consbr prosbr build qualitybr sound qualitybr hard casebr comfortbr br consbr nit picking if anything the ear pads barely fit around my smaller than average ears for everyone else i had try on the headphones they said the ear pads sat on the tops or bottom of the earbr br conclusionbr these headphones feel high quality sound high quality and being focused towards hand held devices it went above and beyond they are so comfortable i could use them for 10 hours a day doing a wide variety of things from listening to music to being enjoyed while being used for gaming on my pc too id love to see monoprice offer aftermarket larger or alternative replacement ear pads such as velorse headphones out on the highsbr br 40 hours of music and gamingbr the sound isolation is remarkable with these headphone i was able to test the sound isolation during my wife’s first 2

me to accurately pin point audio within games and hunt down my opponents  making a phone call with the headphones using the build in mic on the cable my voice came through clearly  the cable has plus minus pause and play buttons the pause play button do as intended and if you double tap that button it also forwards to the next track  this was very nice when i didnt want to reach for the devicebr br pros and consbr prosbr build qualitybr sound qualitybr hard casebr comfortbr br consbr nit picking if anything the ear pads barely fit around my smaller than average ears for everyone else i had try on the headphones they said the ear pads sat on the tops or bottom of the earbr br conclusionbr these headphones feel high quality sound high quality and being focused towards hand held devices it went above and beyond they are so comfortable i could use them for 10 hours a day doing a wide variety of things from listening to music to being enjoyed while being used for gaming on my pc too id love to see monoprice offer aftermarket larger or alternative replacement ear pads such as velor
16344622_R11YZM6GJVDE6X 5 great set of headphones crystal clear and very comfortable charge pretty quickly too
5283826_R3UBAIISJYGKR9 5 i am very pleased with this product
30605496_R2RVCEQT3ENVZ1 5 great product i bought this because i use my cell for conference calls frequently and the sound quality on those calls for myself and the others on the call is superb then i tried listening to the tunes on my playlist and wow might not be the highest rated inear product on the market for listening quality as opposed to the 200 offerings but it is more than acceptable for me and the price is right good cloth bag to carry too i highly recommend it
45084565_RJ9S2IJ7ODO3H 4 its a carbon fiber looking case that fits my ausdom m04 headphones  although this is a ausdom case it fits other types of cans that can swivel to fold it also has a little mesh flap on the inside to hold detachable cables or some batteries if neededbr br its not a true hard case but its perfectly fine to stick in a backpack and take your headphones on the go  the quality seems good and im pretty happy with it
20372473_R13IS84SQR9ZRG 5 i am hard on anything like ear buds but have had np trouble with these
30019921_R162G802KVC68L 5 terrific
4543078_R2LMU59KX7FGXX 5 i just got these today but the reason im writing this review already is because this is my second pair i had these exact ones around mid 2014 and these have been the best pair i have owned the bass is really there not over the top but just perfect the reason i got a second pair was because i dropped some brake fluid on them and the fluid eats through plastic like nothing nothing wrong with the headphones but gettin these and listening to them makes me fall in love again these headphones make you hear sounds you didnt even know were there ive owned beats and they dont compare to these in sound quality or price if your deciding between these and beats get the sol republics
38934280_RHQOTMXYO4AX4 5 these headphones work very well  ever since sony discontinued mdrw08l ive been looking for a replacement  these are almost identical  sound quality is great too
37655693_R1628SANELS4GA 2 i had a sony xb500 that i purchased back in in 2012 for 50 on ebay brand new  i fell in love with the booomy bass that headphone had  i loved it  it didnt muddy the highs as much as the beats did  but its not a stylish headphone at all  the cables are v design which impedes keyboard  mouse activities if using at your deskbr br i have been looking to replace that xb500 for the last 2 months  i bought this after some of you wrote unbelievable glowing reviews  one guy said its he best bass headset he ever used  rubbish  all of you need to hear a paid of xb500 or xb700  it will blow you awaybr br i ask you all to try the xb series xb500 and xb700  the xb1000 are more reference like this vmoda and does not have the boomy bassbr br headphones i tried sofar to replace the xb500br br vmoda m100br mdrxb90ex good but not even close to boomy bassbr ath m50br sony mdrxb950bt absolute junk rubbishbr br unfortunately sony discontinued this unbelievable series and the price has shot up  in sydney the xb1000 is sold at 495 used crazybr br the 50 xb500 is now around 300 on ebay and amazon  this is crazybr br but also it means that it is unbelievably good sound and even at 300 it sounds way better than this vmoda
52407325_R29GLEN8Y0IPUA 3 i bought these bluetooth headphones to use with my 7th generation ipod nano and they work pretty well they pair easily with the ipod they sound good enough to my aging ears but there are a few problems one should be aware ofbr br on two occasions the headphones and ipod became strangers and repairing them was a little tediousbr br if the ipod is in my butt pocket the sound skips in the earphones shirt pocket works much betterbr br the included ear hooks are mostly useless they position the earphones so far from the ear canal that you really have to crank up the volume to hear anything the good news is that the hae hooks break fairly easily so they can be discardedbr br the rubber earbud tips are too big for my ear canal ymmv i tried replacing them with smaller tips from other earbuds and promptly lost the microscopic screens that keep ear crud out of the works my badbr br and thats why i rate this product three stars
106872_R27XIXVSF4NABP 5 are they good for gaming
39997329_R1BP92VCJDV6WD 1 ive been using amazon for years but this is my first product review i purchased these through this listing from la sound but sent by amazon the speakers in these 34new34 headphones were caked in ear wax and one didnt even work
30975802_R2NDXPJXVOZUV2 5 i bought this as a fathers day gift to my husband  we have several bose products and of course he simply loves this headphone  he already had the over the ear but he fell in love with this smaller unit when he tried out my sons model  like the over the ear this on ear headphone sports a perfect and comfortable fit and the sound is clear and crisp as all bose products are  thanks bose you have another satisfied customer
24097242_R340TB4K28OTK 5 as promised
16947020_R2O01O1HIV0YWB 4 i wish there were louder but they are the best ones ive gotten so far
1990651_R9PNO6XE0OFYB 5 i was so impressed after buying the black leather ones that i had to get the velor ones too  if i had the money id collect all 9 color variants they are that good
14745550_R36QH6S1BI9QBL 5 i had a few pairs of gogroove ear buds before as always the sound quality lives to my expectation good job
39766106_R3M2RX72TIUGAV 4 ive found all the philips products ive owned to be of high quality and these headphones are no exceptionbr br theyre nicely designed and built to last the sound quality is excellent and the headphones do a great job of blocking external noisebr br the cushioning for the ears is really comfortable and as the product page claims it is breathable materialbr br the only thing that isnt great about these headphones is the band that goes over the head it stays put nicely not sliding around or anything but i just think the band could have been made to be a bit more comfortable for the wearer its not awful or anything its just there it puts just enough pressure on the head that i have a hard time forgetting its there i tried adjusting the headband so it wasnt sitting right on top of my head but the pressure on the ears wasnt enough to hold it in place so it slid off its a matter of personal preference but id like less pressure on the top of the head and more on the ears where theres cushionbr br because of the comfort issue i dont use these as my allthetime headphonesbr br that being said these are perfect travel headphones the foldflat design is great you can put them in your laptop case your purse your overnight bag wherever and they take up very little room about 634 x 434 x 134br br all in all a solid product
25485256_RE4XZZEFTSYC9 5 item arrived sooner than anticipated it does the job i love it
11971242_RDI6DPRMBOOJ1 4 controls can be a bit frustrating at times but overall i really like these headphones they fit well sounds is good
4629926_R1EICG0YSHMC2G 5 love it  had no problem installing and once the batteries charged it was excellent  no problems so far
2929912_RELNFYGUU45SI 5 just buy it
30269578_R10HOZI8DZ3O9I 5 as of now they work great and can hear out of them very very well
42982739_R1VQYBBUOTSUXI 5 it extends your headphone cords seriuosly  it makes them longer a lot longer man oh man where has this thing been all my life
2372958_RMP30OELJ5OY9 5 great color and product
14842105_R1WXTBLDBSEDOR 3 i am giving this 3 stars with the hopes that people may actually read what i got to say do not buy this headphone set i used for a day and packed it for a return with the speed of light i am a musician my ear is trained to sounds the white noise you are about to experience with these headphones is going to drive you crazy no matter what the frequency you set the dock at  that noise will be there lower or louder it is there and does not go away another thing i absolutely hate about these headphones is all the wires that they take in order to function when think wireless you dont expect a ton of wires the dock needs to be plugged into an outlet it is retarded one would think the dock would charge and then function without being plugged in at all times think about this wanting to use these headphones on your laptop you have to tie down your laptop to the dock which is wired to the wall making your laptop stuck at a very rigid position cant do much defies its purpose and even if you lets say hold your laptop sitting right next to an outlet there are wires all over you the padding on the headphones feels cheap like an 80s walkman these headphones also do not seal very well everyone within 3 feet radius will hear exactly what you are doing and there is no bass god if you listen to anything with a deep bass these headphones sound like they are about to fall apart and of course just like everyone else i found the tuner nob right next to the volume absolutely impractical lets say you laid down on your couch listening to an audio book if you moved a little too much chances are youd hit that tuner and the clarity of the connection goes to hell last but not least they are unreasonably stupid expensive for what you get i paid an extra 10  and got a pair of studio akgs that come with a 3 meter cable instead best decision ever just like these were the worst decision ever sennheiser have another pair thats like 29 and that pair is notwireless but it is miles better more durable and sound efficient than these disgusting waste of money headphones
13709447_R1Z4Q203Q7KPLH 4 good still it could have been better for the price quite crisp sound excellent mids
22062837_RO4VFE9K7HV82 5 the entire family loves these headphones  i bought a pair for my sister last christmas because she goes through headphones like crazy and these actually lasted her 7 months  she said it was the best pair of earbuds she had ever owned so i decided to get three more pairs  i tried them out tonight at the gym and they were great  i have very small ears and these not only fit and didnt hurt but also stayed in place through sweat and running on the treadmill  very good quality for the price
39741178_R1I5UX9651CMGO 1 weow what a beautiful blue cordbr br thats pretty much it 40 dollars for this reallybr lets start with sound quality  first off the sound quality isnt even good theyre okay at best in fact audiotechnicas 14 dollar earphones are way better than these earphonesbr br but what pisses me off the most how easy it is for this thing to break ive had it for 1 month 1 month for 40 dollars honestly ive never been this disappointed in my whole amazon career
51209967_R2AF4SK180AP2W 4 these headphones come in a soft and easy to carry case  of course they are much larger than inear headphones but they are lightweight  the inner part of each earpiece is marked with a large r and l so its easy to tell which ears the pieces go on the headphones adjust easily by pulling the earpiece up or down so the fit is perfect  as id expect from bose the sound is very good and i find these more comfortable than the inear headphonesbr br the only minus for me is that these arent noise canceling i can still hear outside noise when im listening to something at a reasonable volume on these headphones that may be a good thing for safety reasons but for plane travel or other times when id rather just escape the outside noise that feature would be a bonus
1344315_R15B2I00K4VSME 3 great headphones but the left ear bus has dropped in volume every time i try to contact them through the website site through multiple devices including my pc it says 34cant send message at this time please try contacting through another method34 the headphones are amazing but this is bs considering i have only had them for a month and half and only use them 11 hours a week i take excellent care of my belongings to make sure they last
51036953_R1A1KJ7SES0UMU 5 ive tried all kinds of different headphones inear and over the ear with a lot of different designs ive tried low end and high end wireless and wiredbr br of all the wired over the ear headphones ive tried these are easily my favorite i do have a pair of wireless over the ear headphones that sound as nice but these are the most comfortable headphones i think ive ever worn they are wide enough to fit completely over the ears so that they dont put any pressure on them that also means that they keep out external sounds pretty effectively without needing to be actively noise canceling they are adjustable for bigger heads like mine and they hold their position easily without putting too much pressure the cushioning is not too soft but soft enough to eliminate any jostling i can even run in these while they hold in place and they do not chafe or rub theres also padding on the bridge so that it doesnt irritate the top of my headbr br they deliver an exceptional range of sound deep basses and high notes and nothing sounds muddled i listen to a lot of music in a variety of styles and they make it sound as good as ive ever heard itbr br they look nice just solid black they dont look cheap they look built to last the connection wire can be removed for storage it has a controller built in to the wire so you can adjust volume pause the music or skip tracks when i listen to these through my laptop the controller will change the volume and pause but controlling the music scanning forward or backwards or skipping to the next or last track only works on my iphone and ipad while i use a wireless headset for working out these are the ones i listen with whenever im working at my desk or with my laptop and these are the ones id bring with my on a trip
32572135_R2UFOK28JVMY3F 5 great product received quickly hooked my teammates up with the other two skins go dogs
6709217_R10W41DZ0LPGE9 5 bought these headphones for my mother who listens to a lot of andrea bocelli and josh groban they work great and produce amazing sound for this price they cant be beat the cable is a bit long however but i would rather have it too long than too short
1563316_R3W51AS20NEX9M 4 great quality headphones the only thing i dont like is that the left earbud wire is shorter than the right but i should have just read the description before i bought them
50600107_R20PUV1VFADYUB 5 good product good price fast delivery
41693591_RK7O24SVNLRYM 1 i had great hopes for this i noticed that the volume would just drop down while i am working out and i cannot increase it it would stay as long as me holding the button pressed not sure if the sweat go in dont wear it to the gym2 times a week and i sweat it with 45 min of cardio the battery only lasts about 15 min now this is going into the thrashbr br gymguy
10382828_R1OXNLQKSTOIDE 5 great sound for the price clear as a bell i use mine daily and they have been perfect every time resilient quality product at a great price will definitely purchase again if i ever lose mine im pretty rough on them and they dont show it at all the wires and actual ear buds hold up great
12481514_R3BH9O08EWKSDM 5 wow id give these five stars if they cost 3 or 4 times as much these afforable and comfortable in ear monitors have great frequency response not overly bassy or trebly just balanced neutral sound also the design is such that they stay in place much better than most in ear monitors i can wear these for hours without ever having to reach up and push them back in my earsbr br make a great inexpensive gift for the audio nerd in your life
27114574_R3G4YL7JVU1X7 4 still works great after a couple of years of light use my only gripe is that the two jacks are not very well marked so you need to look closely to avoid swapping the headphones and mic but i keep it permanently attached to my headset so this isnt an issue for me
24161352_R1C76AY59L860A 3 earbuds died within 3 months of having them  i received a 20 warranty voucher towards the purchase of a new pair from their site  willing to give them another shot
10935067_RB1JZ0R1GCJQE 1 these are decently comfortable for the price i would expect absolute comfortable at its finest for these earbuds at this price the sound quality is completely disappointing i have 20 skullcandy earbuds that are way more audio acoustic impressive than these save your money by skullcandys or something cheaper these are way overrated very disappointed in bose
287453_R2V4DFK3N9G4IC 5 perfect was everything i was hoping they would be brand new love it
39814521_R1J72BUD7RYMI5 2 i purchased these headphones a couple of years ago through a licensed vendor i have enjoyed the sound quality and have used them mainly while flying the noise cancellation is very good probably not as good as the bose but that is based on subjective data overall ive enjoyed these headphones although it seems that their life span is about 2 years with light use  mine are no longer working due to the fraying of the wires where they adjust
10131980_R2I9NIFRPO7CO5 4 great sound and stay in ears better than most earbuds but still try to bounce out while running
50684717_R85G77SBO0FB5 1 the buds are really uncomfortable  im unsure why they were designed this way  the actual buds look like apple buds but since they can only sit at one angle due to the neck band form factor they end up inside of your ear in a pretty painful way  im sure the angle works if your head circumference turns out to be just right but otherwise these will be painfulbr br also the microphone on this headset is really bad all in all a poor purchasebr br pros inexpensive decent sound quality for the price lightweight easy bluetooth pairing
42470595_R1BZX57URSLUML 4 i really like these headphones but over time the stress on the headband causes them to break easily on the sides but no worries just be mindful of it and if you have to eventually replace i think its worth it to do so
1612020_RSXHDE723IQLB 1 i really wanted to like these headphones  they were stylish and seemed pretty sturdy  however after a few hours of listening they started to get a little glitchy  i began to hear dj khaled speaking to me through the headphones he told me i was 34smart34 34loyal34 and that he 34appreciated that34  another annoying thing was that after i would finish listening to them and unplug the jack from my phone i heard khaled say 34another one34 through the headphones and his song 34how many times34 would start playing even though it wasnt connected to anything  i still cant figure out why all these things are happening anyway these weird glitches with the headphones ruined them for me
12804078_R24UZYZBW5CLUE 5 these aroundear headphones are super comfortable like almost wearing nothing at all bose has made a very nicefitting and extra lightweight set of gear that i can wear for hours at a time i use them when i telecommute for my work in the evenings without the slightest discomfortbr br sound reproduction is well above average but i have used other headphones that are slightly better in this area than the soundtrue ii those headphones are also more expensive these are not noise canceling but thee aroundear design does help a bit in muffling ambient noisebr br although i do not use the inline controls apple iproducts they are a nice perk and do work well when paired with an iphone ipod or ipadbr br one thing ive learned about bose one can appreciate their attention to detail and product integrity the soundtrue ii headphones are another great and very affordable addition to this lineup of favorite audio accessories
51902268_RK7CJOV23LBPA 3 broke after a few months of usemaybe try a better quality item
30440152_R9E83IG6YPIZK 5 really liked these i ordered a pair of the ear zonk replacement bowls for the grados and was disappointed see my review on that pair but these were great nice quality great feel and firm fit with the plastic retaining clips i enjoy the sound change from my on ear pads since these have the opening and my ears are pretty small they fit almost completely over ear i do get a little soreness on my ears after a few consecutive hours of listening but its not really noticeable until i remove them an its bearable to me anyways i highly recommend these
1114400_R2OUFV9U8MUOFL 3 my son uses these constantly wire is already wearing down
870136_R1MB8MM4ZKC2FT 5 met or exceeded all my expectations
47455062_R2PFZ88CRUVU6B 4 happy with product good gift for my 11 yo girl
3595750_R2A744I5CH9Z8O 1 this is not real   i bought this to replace my actual beats cord because the small front black piece around the volume control came off however this cord changed the entire sound of my music so i took the small piece off these and put on my authentic beats now im satisfied 😉br if i could give no stars i would 😔
614628_R1E6QV2HY3A31K 5 great replacement
44298723_RYETR1L1063BI 5 these are perfect  feels and looks like the originals  im a gym rat and these have been holding up very well
23734457_R2AO53FR16WAC0 1 these were gorgeous earbuds but they distorted the sound i would have to change the equalizer each time a new genre of song came on to make them sounds normal i returned them
52690060_R10D586DCH1QWN 5 this is a nice set of bluetooth headphones my thoughts are belowbr br  comfortable importantbr  impressive sound quality for the money has aptx codec support for 34cd quality34 sound over bluetooth bass is strong and deep mids and highs are good toobr  i could not find the led at first i thought mine was defective or the led was out but the led is there its just really smallbr  i like the 3 button controller i find it easier to use than if the controls were either of the earphones but the buttons are not marked they are easy to feel for thoughbr  i had no problem pairing to my ipad air 2br  the included black and red zipper case and additional earphone tips 3 silicone in small medium and large and 1 s400 foam add to the valuebr  i did not experience any range issuesbr  the earphones do stick out from your ears farther than most other earphonesbr  12 month warrantybr br overall i like the design comfort and especially the sound quality of the earphonesbr br note i was sent a free product sample for review i was not paid or told what to write
33360765_RB0QAS8UU9WZC 5 nearly identical to the discontinued sony mdrw08l though twice the price they are a good value  they are a basic pair of jogging headphones which usually last for 5 or 6 months before the sweat ruins them  perfect for the gym or travelling as they are cheap enough to loose  good sound range and comfortable in the ear and on the head a great alternative in these earbudcrazy times  thanks sonxtronic ill be buying more
12839320_R2NUW4HBCDVRAN 5 just as described works  perfect i would recommend this product to family and friends
24990816_R3755BKU6OK6V4 2 one side crapped out on me after 3 months good until then now sound only in one bud boo  edit 9302015 they did finally give me a refund so i added one star
2863648_R24EFFB0ZNB1K9 5 love it my headphone fix perfectly in it
12481514_R1208073X56CPX 2 ugh really not very good really muddy no treble to speak of uncomfortable for any length of time to wear do not recommend you can do better for the same or a similar price
8301678_R34HIHTS4VI2P9 1 i was under the impression the light weight was from the hollow wood that improved acoustics of the headphones nope its because theyre cheap they were twice the price when i bought them they cut out with heavy metal or hiphop and after only four months theyve completely crapped out the right side just cracks and i can barely hear the left sidebr br i did try to exchange them but tribeca only offers a 30day warranty im fine with that i wouldnt want another pair anyways i went back to philips i had philips oneil stretches that lasted for over 4 years but theyve been discontinued i shouldve just moved on and got the philips l128s they have l2s nowbr br bottom line tribeca aviators are garbage but now theyre 30 thats a fitting price
50466007_R3IYJHPTB5D04H 5 best youll get for the price ive tried several different cheap headphones and im sticking with these from now on
50128857_R28EPZYI369A1P 3 sound is great but if its windy it interfers with the music
52996938_R2TH52QXMLA6FC 5 these are perfect to keep from disturbing the neighbors  i can walk to the mail box and not miss any of the audible books or baseball game
2910642_RPGPPK36ZUG5B 3 ive had many earbuds over the years and i have to say that these arent anything special the buds tend to fall out frequently so dont expect to do any sort of physical activity with these mostly due to the cheap quality of this product but i will say that the sound quality is a bit of an improvement compared to a set of cheapo earbuds
44062503_RYBJFFCK1PMQA 5 love it
20590080_R1SGLVXUIVHC2M 4 so let me say this is four stars for the value  there are better sounding headphones in the world but none for this price i have heardbr br pairs easily with all my devices so far buttons on the side all work well but feel a little cheapbr br i am not in love with the flashing blue led on the side convinced me cops were pulling behind me on night jog at least oncebr br ear pads are vinyl and can get a little sweaty but this hasnt bothered me 95 of the timebr br feel durable but they are plastic so havent had them long enough to saybr br all in all they are a tremedous value and even better when on sale
46560384_R36JBN9GBVS5XD 1 not worth the plastic they were shipped in i initially thought something was wrong with them but reading the rest of the reviews it seems like we all just got what we paid forbr br purchased as a throwaway set of headphones i can use while sleeping to talkonly podcasts i ruin more sets than id like to admit they were barely audible and the pause play button was uselessbr br spend a little more get something worth your time
930434_R3B6JUHQREOPF 1 i ordered them and when they arrived they did not work
512630_R19S5J6LI2EOTL 5 really good
43543270_R1RBX67VJGH34K 4 highs are good and sharplows are not good quality is fantastic
23826451_R2QXSRLR8UBDOI 5 videoidd0d57fe4b22b77e916d09fc7f810f699i have always heard that i need to get a pair of wood earbuds well now i have a pair and they are great they look amazing but not only that they feel good in your ear  when you open up the package you get different size earbuds to fit every ones ears  they have a very clear sound to them they also sound good when you are on the phone they have a built in mic boom for you can keep your earbuds in your ear  the bass is great and hits hard  they come with a nice carrying case for them for when you stick them in your pocket they dont get all dirty  they come in all kinds of different colors  i love the fact that these have a tangle free cordbr i got this item at a discounted price for a honest review
937355_RIFKZ1KV0TZ3F 5 i love these guys ive had my pair for 3 or four years now theyve finally started giving up on me haha the funny part about it i wear these in the shower and all the time yet they only stopped working in one side a week after i lose the cover for that side they are the most durable headphones ive ever seen i told my friend this and he took them and threw them across the room i smiled went over and picked them up then continued rocking out to journey the only problem ive had with them is the speakers are removable and can fall out if the cover isnt on they arent hard to put back in just watch for the wiresbr also note after using a friends beats i didnt hear much of an audio difference only slightly less bass
11339267_R15TES6IE2KYO0 4 very cutie sound quality is great and very durable they stopped working on one side after 6 months all in all a good buy
12746687_R49LHIMLN0EEQ 5 very comfortable fit and it feels very solidly built been using it for a few weeks now and im really happy with the sound too very balanced not a ton of bass but no complaints about it really
2430906_R2MRBGO46BRHJA 5 these headphones are virtually identical to the nowdiscontinued jaybird sportsband headphones  actually forget 34virtually identical34 they are completely identical except that these are 13 of the price of the jaybirds  i always liked the sportsband because a intheyear headphones get very uncomfortable after a while b the sportsbands are designed to deal with sweat and c the sound quality is good  all of these things are true of the gogroove too although i dont know yet about the sweat resistance since ive only had them for a few weeks  the headphones syncd with no problem to the jaybird usport bluetooth adapter  you cant beat these for the price and i just hope they prove to be durable
33941947_R2BOZU4JFS52PO 4 for the price these are fantastic theyre not going to have superflat response like a 300 pair of grados obviously but theyre comfortable and sound great they have a long cable which has survived being rolled over by office chairs a few timesbr br my only gripe is that the frames are plastic and arent indestructible in all fairness they got sat on by a kid so i bought another pair cant beat them for the price
22683802_R1KIQ6XBQHJBY 2 i was very disappointed with these i read all the great reviews and i thought these would be perfect for me i have a rather large head and my ears stick out so over the ear headphones are very hard to find that dont make my ears hurt after an hour of wearbr br at first i really loved these headphones they look like they should cost 100 and there is nice padding on the ear pieces the headband piece also adjusted to fit my head it comes with a carrying case so you can fold it up and store them neatly without breaking them i also really liked the flat cord because it minimizes tangles and tearsbr br however i had two big problems with these headphones after a day of use 1 they leak noise very badly raising the volume past 50 on your spotify or itunes will pretty much make your music audible to the whole room i wanted to use these headphones in the library when i study but the noise leakage problem made that impossible 2 after an hour of wear my ears started to ache when i wear them true the band itself was long enough to fit over my head but they compressed my ears uncomfortably the ear pieces were too small to create a nice noise cancelling suctionbr br im returning these
1673704_RDEQSVN7IJEZT 5 best headphones ever period the end
601093_R2TLZVB0W39BSE 4 good quality only problem is lots of noise from the zipper scratching against the other sides as you listen to music and do almost anything highly suggest 455
45679307_R38RHP8UAXI7VU 5 my headphones needed to be longer to connect to my computer at work and this is the perfect for extending my headphones  the connecting tools are great too if you want to listen to a computer or something together  perfect
611235_R22EUKQT2SHM58 1 broke first week had to send it back amazon made it easy to send back kudos for them
1080254_R1RVC6E3XBULAL 5 great headphones
44263788_R3HFPJ24L66DY 5 stays in ears
43671016_RJM75KURLB32V 1 decent sound but if i exercise with it for more than 30 minutes it sticks on a song or jumps on its own to the next song also you continually have to delete and repair it also does not function well for phone calls  update after 6 weeks they totally stopped working  these are absolute junk
45381665_R5R18U3HT560Y 5 did very well
16194007_R2AHMC60NR11E1 5 these are just great headphones great sound reproduction
14620032_R14C3E8KNPY8YJ 4 these ear phones are great  pros 1 comfortable very nice earbuds good cord length and flexible ear supports that you can form to your ear 2 sweat resistant dont want to jinx it but my heavy sweating has not been effected 3 battery life pry around 5 hours or three gym visits  4 no microphone as someone who box jumps squats runs etc the fact that these do not have a microphone that shifts the cord to one side and or bounces and hits me in the face during my entire work out is extremely nice 5 sound great sound for a bluetooth headset they take about 3 times of use to be broken in as the sound kind of sucks until this point  cons 1 the ear supports arent perfectly symmetrical and i had a problem with one ear bud being much smaller than the other easily fixed by using a slightly bigger bud on one of the ear phones    edit so about 6 months into use the ear supports began to break at the base where they connect to the larger earpieces i should have listed this as a con previously as i had thought this might happen but did not photive clearly understood the problem as the corrected it in their upgraded model   the second issue i have is that although photive will replace the earphones i 1 need to send the earphones back to them before they send me a new pair i understand this is a 34needy34 or 341st world problem34 but as that will leave me without headphones for over 2 weeks using standard shipping it is quite annoying especially considering rival companies such as h2o audio have sent my replacements immediately with prime shipping with no need to send the broken earphones back to the sender  2 i would have thought they would have given me the upgraded version of the headphones as h2o audio did as they understood and fixed the problem in those headphones with their newer version   due to these issues and the fact the earphones broke in less than 7 months i have downgraded them from 5 to 4 stars and pry would have done 35 if possible
384360_R345OJZGRFUKNO 5 satisfied
16799019_R2ATJCZK9WFCU9 4 worked fine for a while but broke when my husbands arm accidentally 34snagged34 the cord
50709460_R2USDPOQGTT4GT 2 the bluedio r revolution is a great sounding pair of headphones for the price i have use the revolutions for work on my computer gaming cellphone and listing to ipod the wireless bluetooth connection is fast and simple i have had my pair of revolutions for over 2 years i even bought a pair for my son after the first year of my ownership the problem with the headphones is quality in the usb connection which is the only way to charge the headphones after years of repeated plugging and unplugging the connection is broken to the headphones so i have a great sounding comfortable wireless pair of headphones with no way to charge them my sons pair only lasted a year after that purchase with the same problem i will most likely open them and try to repair the connection
29114181_R23Q410NF94BB3 5 sounds awesome  looks good in blue nice packaging too
45764948_RMDJHGAU8MJBK 5 headphones are simply awesome major plus extra rubber ear pieces
46255957_R2KHW6SE0PD1WB 5 i love these headphones i did a lot of research before settling on them and im sure i got the best possible headphones for my price range my only complaint is that they get uncomfortable after an hour or two of use  they dont 34breathe34 which can get stifling on my ears great design though and extremely well built ive had mine for about six months and theyre still in perfect condition i feel sure theyll last yearsbr br highly recommended for anyone who loves to hear the subtleties in their music i mostly listen to nonvocal music and theres great depth and texture to every instrument even in complex classical songs its like hearing your music in 343d34 for the first time
26423931_RTN1T3IBD4RTT 2 my son used these for only a couple of months and one side of them already stopped working
32719973_R10MSGERCKGRKK 4 a
17608821_R10TV1XDF9538W 5 awesome
592803_R1A9AW4VZTJ9LS 5 its totally worth it and it actually arrived a day sooner than expected
14273890_R15V3Z9YLK91NB 4 these are some good little headphones for the money i constantly lose headphones and can never find them when it comes time to go running or to keep myself occupied while doing some yard work these can take a good amount of volume without sounding too tinny the bass is also surprising good with these the only thing i have to say negatively about these is that they are very lightweight and feel somewhat cheap to the touch they do however stay in my ears even while running and bonus they come with several extra rubber earpiece covers if you need something quick and of reasonable quality but dont want to spend a bunch these are your headphones
42211681_R1AD3IQH0LOK5K 5 very comfortable headphones sound is great i am very pleased with the headphonesbr this product was received at a reduced price by the manufacturer in order to facilitate a review please contact me if you have any questions
42691715_R2ESMZEVAFP1I8 5 they are great
36076929_R1YFH6MHJ71419 4 sometimes i get some feedback and they begin to make my ears sore after long periods of wear over 30 minutes  i use them every time i go to the gym
3338288_R2L35IL6QRNBS9 5 excellent choice
28109952_R5T8R34J77019 2 very tinny sounding and terrible echo yeah only 8 so you cant expect much but these arent worth 8 pay a buck or two more to get a better pair
40108387_R30RPUKH7AHWLY 4 yes they are the best headphones in their price range you will not be dissapointed especially since you can get them for under 100 every now and thenbr br my only complaint is that the wire is built in it would be nice if they had a 35mm jack so you could use any cable you prefer i use these with my computer and the long bungy cord is a bit annoying plus i have taken them on the road a few times it would be nice to switch out the cable for a more modest 34ft when travelingbr br  i added a modmic 40 to these are they work great for gamingbr br i did recently switch to philip fidelio x1 headphones but i wouldnt say they are necessarily drastically better they seem better on the low end but they also dont go as loud from a computerphone without an external amp where are the sonys go louder then i need from my computers headphone jack
24297196_R2LXFENM6HKRD3 5 received timely and it is great the sound is superb and it covers ears good without being uncomfortable
48423957_RGQB7115K4TX1 5 great bluetooth earbuds  no problems with sound quality even when doing yard work or riding bike  they are very comfortable to wear for several hours at a time  i would recommend  this product
48283655_R3IR163UEHA6GK 1 worst headset ive ever ordered  its difficult sometimes impossible to even get it to turn on then when it 34works34 everything sounds distorted at all times
175701_R15J540884OIE2 5 actually waterproof  i got swimming with them in the pool sound clarity is perfect underwater definitly worth the money
49659528_R2RO9QS78OP78C 5 unpackage power up and play
44617810_R1MV9ZV96Q97QF 5 worked perfectly for what i needed lets me use any stand headset with my phone
15708284_R2EV2704QX7058 5 love these earphones they stay in my ears well and the sound is very good thanks
43168923_RA1RNVHXJXRKI 5 look great sound great worth the price paid cords that come with are a nice touch case is awesome
49990062_R22B71A2ABOBAC 3 decent sound but the pads do not cover the ears well at least for me so they do not block outside sounds well which is the whole point of buying closed headphones
2528707_R3H0JAJ17U5AMD 5 ive used symphonized nrg as my primary before they broke on me those had amazing sound but this sound is very clear and seems more immersive and intimate i think the mids and highs are incredible best ive heard so farthe bass is good but definitely not super strong but its definitely depending on how the song was produced too so test out different genres this isnt a bass oriented iem but its definitely great still the bass is on the tighter side yet punchy and a pretty good amount of bass would love if it had a tad bit more bass but it isnt that necessary to make it listenable anyway its bright clear and more neutral comes with awesome accessories  like nice case and bag too also many choices of earbud piece sets
39789300_R22TQ53NMMJOHU 5 these blu100 earphones solve two of the biggest problems with most similar bluetooth earphones  bulkiness and poor audio quality  they only weigh about 12 g  they are not much bigger than the average nonbluetooth earphone and they are just as comfortable to wear  the audio quality is much better than expectedbr br the 60 mah battery charges in about two hours with the included usb cable and then will last for over three hours of listening to music  a white led indicates charging status  the battery life is the compromise made to achieve compactness but three hours is longer than i would normally use them in one stretch and they do recharge quickly  the cover for the charging port is wellmade and securebr br the bluetooth pairs painlessly as blu100 and then repairs automatically  there is audio confirmation when powering on and off and connecting  the bluetooth is the latest generation and uses the aptx codec so it is effectively equivalent to a wired connection  it can pair with two devicesbr br the slim flat cable is 24 in long and resistant to tangling  microphonics are average but the cable does tend to swing and hit the chest the inline controls are on the right and include complete functionality for both music and calls  the microphone is clearbr br listening to music with these earphones is a pleasure  isolation is good with the right size tip  the audio is clear and without noticeable defects  soundstage is very good for this type of earphone  there is a slight bass emphasis that is more apparent at louder volumes  mids and vocals are sharp and right up front  treble is adequate but the lower ranges are where the excitement is  anyone who has being using the earphones that came with their phone is in for a real treatbr br they come loaded with accessories including a doublezippered hardshell case with interior pockets  small medium and large silicone tips  medium comply s400 foam tips  optional silicone stabilizers  a hook  loop strip and a charging cable  they have a one year warranty against manufacturing defectsbr br mp4nation provided earphones for evaluation and reviewoptional silicone stabilizers  a hook  loop strip and a charging cable  they have a one year warranty against manufacturing defectsbr br mp4nation provided earphones for evaluation and review
16280842_R325HM7GCF5MPQ 5 my teenager loves these bluetooth is really the way to go when youre active but want a fuller sound with the comfort of on the ear headphones shes discriminating and likes the sound  i say its no where near top quality but clearly its good enough
7207393_R2QP2S76S47FQZ 1 i really wanted to like these earbuds they seemed amazing especially for the price i dont know why i waited so long to write this review i guess because now im searching for a new pair of earbuds these were used mostly for computer use and light travel in which 2 trips i lost 1 tip each meaning there was only 1 complete set left within 2 weeks of owning these the filters unscrew very easily and loosen and fall off on their own the attachment on the left earbud attaching the earbud to the cable came loose within a month and started to fall off losing sound in the left earbud i did manage to secure it back in with wood glue but after a few more days sound continued to cut in and out only helping when i shoved it back in there as hard as possiblebr i must say they do have great sound quality however
1974236_R1EC6VBQ28U2N5 5 great headphones for working out  lots of options for different ears they stay on your ears and get loud
45591614_R756U8CP86U3I 2 not as good as my old sony pair which is no longer produced  you get what you pay for not much
29800947_R1TW6W3VBLZE7G 5 so much better than anything else for the price of course theyre not some crazy bose 250 nonsense but if you usually buy headphones from the dollar store this is worth the five bucks the five buck ones at drugstores and target are never worth the mark up when they are just as much of a crapshoot as the dollar ones as to if they will even work much less sound like anything if they do these however sound like they were at least 3040 quite decent
22073528_R22WY0NRYFZ473 1 all i received was the head phones no charging cable or the carrying case  neither was a big deal as i would most likely never have used the case and i have many charging cables  the problem was they didnt work  they would not charge and would never turn on  its too bad they look really good and fit nice and snug
11008220_R247DAYBTVJZ5D 5 these are wonderful headphones and with the special coloring each member of the family finds it easier to keep track of their own headphones
46295086_R1KB3HFULA7SSZ 1 this sucks  poorly made  huge transmitter to plug into tv  which is really inconvenient
11382631_R1KD8HMMOR7A52 5 love these headphones  they are the most comfortable ones ive ever worn and stay in my ears well  sound is pretty good as far as i can tell but im not a big time audiophile
40338963_R1G4DQBHCLGTT0 4 excellent condition
26099558_R1DY6YT6DEYBO7 5 my daughter loves these she say hello kitty and picked them right away i am glad that i found kid ones for her  little ears
21202797_RL9W2O4TZBGC9 3 one of the two broke fairly easily  it is a weak point where the headphones fold in and thats exactly where it came loose and wires were exposed
17732414_R1MMONTF3D09B7 3 i would have rated these 4 stars or more given what i paid they sound great and have great range  i bought mine in dec 14  by may they were providing intermittent sound on all devices  i rarely use them except when everyone is asleep and i want to watch loud tv  so we are talking after less than 10 uses  sound would just cut out every 23 seconds  i just sent them back to the mfg for another pair thankfully that was an easy process  well see if the other pair does better
20980879_R27Y4FKXHVPTF5 5 fits a small ear without falling out its nice that it has two sizes so you can custom fit it to your size good price and shipped so fast
38354944_RHL9R31H4D9GD 5 of all my searching for good foam tips i finally reached a verdict love these shure medium tips everyones ears  ear canals are different but for me these are great excellent seal and noise isolation very comfortable i can wear for hours without fatigue only thing i did was took some tweezers and rip out the rubbery mesh net thats inside to block ear was from reaching your iembr br improved the audio quite a bit these will be my always go to tips from now on im using with a pair of westone um pro 30 the original westone tips were too long for me also the westone plastic lining tears off the foam buds after little use plus my ear canal is too shallow for westones deep fitting foam tips
39268516_R283PMUIWT4ZAP 4 i actually really liked this headphones i put them up against what i consider thebr gold standard for headphonesthe wired sennheiser hd 650 cans with cardasbr premium cords and a mf vcan mkii external amp off of my main home sonybr amp i did not do extensive comparisons but the one cd that i really go to forbr midtones and high notes is george winstons autumn album particularly the woodsbr selection these wireless headphones with my 34aged34 hearing came as close to thebr 650s as i could detect someone with better hearing than i could give a morebr thorough report i would not buy these headphones at this price with inferior audiobr source material i returned the headphones for economic reasons given some unexpectedbr  expenses that i incurred just recently
27317573_R3BCJRYR6WUZHI 5 wow bought these as i was so so curious as to what a 3000 headphone would sound like i mean i already have a set of lcdx and el8s not too shabbyor so i thought when these arrived the build feel and fit were the best i have seen in a headphonebr br in the past i have owned or tested sennheiser hd800 1500 audeze lcdx 1700 and audeze lcd3 1900 i have all owned many headphones in the 200600 range so i feel i am ok to write about these high end headphones as i have heard high end sound and been involved in high end audio for 20 yearsbr br 1st off my amp is an alo audio studio 6 with the studio 6 phono stage i use a yamaha 2100 scd playerdac for my digital source 3000br br i have a nice setup but it is not the be all end all of course i would say my setup is mid level i have heard tons of high end gear from 10k systems to 200k systems even a million dollar system on one occasion not mine of coursebr br no i am not rich not even close i just buy the things in life that i get enjoyment from i am not a fan of rvs expensive watches fancy cars boats or large houses so i buy things like this as i get massive life enjoyment from them just how i live lifei concentrate on what i love and enjoybr br with that out of the way these headphones are the best i have ever heard period not even close either compared to my lcdx the he1000s are on another level entirely for presentation flow organic richness huge soundstage clarity detail imaging in fact i loved my lcdx after the he 1000 it is very tough to go back to them the lcdx have the thump drive and slam but they lack the finesse amazing holographic sound and creamy silky mids of the he 1000br br voices sound eerily real musiceach instrument has its place in the soundstage the sound is not in your head it is way outside of the head close your eyes dim the light and you are therebr br i would say this headphone competes with 2 channel speaker systems upwards of 40k they are that good so max i feel there could be more slam and impact dynamics the he 1000 is very natural not neutral and lacks massive slam and kick ebr br i would say this headphone competes with 2 channel speaker systems upwards of 40k they are that goodbr verything is just a tad 34soft34 but this is awesome as it makes everything sound so so good unheard of good as in you probably never heard anything like this on your earsbr br so congrats to hifiman they succeeded in draining 3k from my wallet the lcdx are now going bye bye and these are stayingbr br these sound  good with all music but if you want aggressive kick slam and music that pounds this is not your headphone this is for those who enjoy a glass of scotch lights out fire on and he 1000s on your head as you seriously get lost in the music with performers coming right into your roombr br thinly headphones that can compete with these are the stax sr009 but that is a huge investment and from what i hear they lack the body of the he 1000 so i would probably much prefer the he 1000 this is a masterpiece in design and sound qualityare that good so max i feel there could be more slam and impact dynamics the he 1000 is very natural not neutral and lacks massive slam and kick e  i would say this headphone competes with 2 channel speaker systems upwards of 40k they are that good verything is just a tad 34soft34 but this is awesome as it makes everything sound so so good unheard of good as in you probably never heard anything like this on your ears  so congrats to hifiman they succeeded in draining 3k from my wallet the lcdx are now going bye bye and these are staying  these sound  good with all music but if you want aggressive kick slam and music that pounds this is not your headphone this is for those who enjoy a glass of scotch lights out fire on and he 1000s on your head as you seriously get lost in the music with performers coming right into your room  thinly headphones that can compete with these are the stax sr009 but that is a huge investment and from what i hear they lack the body of the he 1000 so i would probably much prefer the he 1000 this is a masterpiece in design and sound quality
29410631_R3EX9Z72JZ079Q 4 works fine please be advised you may need an analog audio decoder and optical cable at an additional cost of about 60 if your tv has wifi and other features
1751396_R2MV30VB38AIUZ 5 worked perfectlyand i love that it came with an extra aux cord thats longerlove this
50351463_RMV9VEFY6DZUL 5 great sound easy to use love the wireless charging  for price theyre great headphones
42780072_R2WG5LM87O7XYD 2 the sound was decent but these headphones were just too uncomfortable for my ears the hooks pinched and the overall unit is somewhat bulky and sticks out more than i would like
48517534_R1DHS11ETCO869 1 i give these headphones a 1 star review for the first week they were awesome i had no problem with them then one day they broke it was exactly 8 days after i got them they snapped on the left side right below the silver strip if they would have not broken i would still be using them and i would give them a 5 star review but nope sorry bludio need to put some more money in your products hope this helps
46429440_R3C5TAVKC16559 5 i work with headphones all the time and i particularly like active noise canceling anc phones the gold standard is bose but you pay a premium if you want those phones one of the issues i have seen with headphones is that many manufacturers claim to have noise canceling phones when they really are just noise isolating phones these phones by agptek are true anc phones and while they are a far cry from bose they are actually good headphonesbr br these are very lightweight and reasonably comfortable phones the padding on the ears is a little stiff but they are not hard i can wear them for a while and they do not get too warm and they do not pinch my ears these are overtheear phones and they fit properly i do not like the headband though  there is no padding on the headband and if you have thin hair or no hair on the top of your head these have no cushion at all and they feel like they’re scraping when you put them on though they are fine once fittedbr br i have noticed that these phones are not the very best when it comes to the sound profile but they are certainly acceptable the best way to describe the sound is “subdued” though these phones are really strange in how they present sound there are tracks i have loaded up and listened to that sound slightly muffled and quiet and at the same time i can hear details i never before noticed with any other headphones i am not sure what to make of the sound profile as these sound different than any other headset i have used but they still sound good an audiophile will not like these phones very much but most will find these to be acceptable i think the sound profile could use a boost in the midrangebr br these headphones have the electronics in them to actively cancel lowfrequency noise so when you have these on and you are on an plane or you are in a noisy car turning on the anc function drastically cuts down on engine and road noise so that you can hear the music better or you can enjoy a quieter ride i have a fan i use to generate white noise and i tried these phones’ anc function with the fan on the anc circuit did cut a good portion of the noise though nowhere near as much as my bose set does that said these do a goodenough job of cutting sound to make them effectivebr br i like the fact that the phones continue to work even when there are no batteries the only thing the batteries affect is the anc functionbr br this headset does one thing correctly that many other phones i have tried has gotten wrong over and over i have seen headphones that boost the volume of the music when the anc function is engaged and the tendency is to overcompensate so the anc function means a substantial volume boost to music and the claim is that the overall volume level remains the same that might be true but it is deceptive this headset does it right  the volume of the music is boost just enough to sound exactly the same whether the anc is on or offbr br probably the most interesting point about these phones is the price these are anc phones and as i write this they sell for under 30 price may change later of course to have anc phones that cost so little and actually work is just amazing to me i used one other similarly priced anccapable set some time ago and it was just awful this set is actually decent it is not up to the same capabilities as a set that costs three times as much but it doesn’t need to be the most important function with this set is the anc and it does work and it works better than some other sets i have seen and usedbr br i could name several sets of headphones that sound better or have better anc but all of them would cost at least double and it’s debatable if the cost difference is worth the difference i use a lot of anc phones and this set is probably the best value of those i have seen and used it is not perfect but the flaws are small when you consider that these cost so little if you specifically want anc phones and you want to keep the cost down consider this setbr br disclaimer i was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair honest and thorough review even though i received this product at no cost i have rated and reviewed this product without bias based solely on my experience with ite cost so little if you specifically want anc phones and you want to keep the cost down consider this setbr br disclaimer i was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair honest and thorough review even though i received this product at no cost i have rated and reviewed this product without bias based solely on my experience with it
28469446_R1MJEOAI0L928M 5 these headphones work great i am not very tech savvy but i can appreciate a good sound the music comes out clearly and with no static even when i raised the volume to super high the bluetooth function worked perfectly and it was easy to pair it with my phone the hands free option is great  i liked the convenience of being able to take phone calls without having to remove them and reconnecting them so the mic comes in handy  the headphones are a bit bulky in my opinion but they are not uncomfortable like some other designs out there the headband adjusts perfectly and the speakers have a very soft cushion so it does not bother your skin these come with a nice case to travel with and to carry around without damaging them i really believe that these headphones are a good alternative to some of those much more expensive brands
37942307_RG08BUXJ2MGIR 1 i purchased these tips or my jaybird bluetooth headset the tips are too small to fit on the earpiece and it took me 10 minutes of wiggling and struggling to finally get them on  when i finally did get them on there was no room for the foam to mold to my ear because they were already stretched thin from fitting on the ear piece after my first run one of the tips had a tear in the foam looking back now i dont know why i ever spent 15 on a product that is simply just 6 pieces of foam
52669179_R22QZU6Q16LHNH 5 an industry standard its simply the best cant go wrong with these for both studio and personal use
49288787_R3MHGXFAASRWOE 2 after just a few months of use i lost hearing in one side of the headphones because of a wire malfunction these headphones are not very durable and only recommended for home use
10674759_R3QO97EFEMT6UB 5 i never had heard about headphone ampdac until i had to replace my old pioneer se 300 for a denon hp700 i had to do this after my ipod headphones were broked so i started to try diferent headphones until i found a very good deal with this denons but after all the denons are not the best portable headphones as earbuds can be so i still looking forward and i bought the soundmagic e10 which was a very good change since my ipod heapdhones then i try with a new improve for my sound buying a dac from creative xfi go i was a little skeptical because my laptop was suppose to have a very good dac msi gaming laptop but the reality was that the sound improved a lot with this cheaper dacthe only drawback i saw on this xfi go was that only can use with my laptop my ipod even my cel phone which is a samsung s5 with a really low volume cannot be used with this small marvel so a time later i move forward and bought a hifiman he400 which according with everybody will need an amp and it is absolutely true so i read a little bit more and found this fiio the benefits of it are a lot you have a portable device you can use with your laptop tablet phone ipod etc this little marvel offers to you a very good sound the improvement over the xfi go was very notable it make sound my three beloved headphones amazing if you have good headphones its mandatory use an ampdac i definitely recommend this product
33609986_RRAF1TI25WRGJ 5 great sound
34405204_R13J5UTG46Y0EF 1 worked perfectly for 15 years great sound great comfort everything perfect then the left ear died ive found enough customers online that had the same thing happen to them to know this is not an isolated occurence audiotechnica support says its impossible to repair and they will sell me a new pair for 140  shipping no thank you
6634103_RAP1JYLSSUMKT 5 these headphones sound awesome whether its with my computer accompanied by a fiio e10k usb dacamplifier or with my lg g3 smartphone the soundstage is especially what makes these headphones stand out from any previous headphones ive used with that said im still new to audiophile equipment and these are a great entrylevel pair of headphones this may not be the case for everyone but ive noticed that the sound doesnt leak nearly as much as i expected it to given these are open back while it is more noticeable with high pitched notes and percussion i wouldnt consider it any worse than leakage from a poor quality pair of earbuds like the stock apple buds
2018655_REC9JV0798BW0 4 its a good product a mildly right fit i have no idea how the tool worked so i used a pair of tweezers to get the to fit they also change the characteristic of the headset they are now very bass heavy get them instantly if thats what you like they are almost beats like sounding i have to increase my treble and most of the mid range and low end all in all a quality product you dont even really need a glue gun to secure them cause they are such a tight fit but do it anyway also do not worry about tearing the corners during application cause they are quite sturdy but the worst part is the price if i had known better i would have bought the amazon basics headphones for 14 bucks instead get these if and only if you really really like your px headphones
10218238_R9OEBEIMRW0LB 4 great sound  i use them to drown out the buzzing of coworkers incessant bitching  sometimes i dont even have music playing  comfortable enough to wear for hours
49264291_RGIHPU2FJRUR 5 only case for these headphones
15303333_R3UU45PGUYTITW 1 the sound is okay but ear bud fell apart on the first use
17188743_R17H4D0EA2KX4X 5 fit better than original more room for my ears smooth high quality easy to put on good guides on youtube how to replace ear cushions
38309269_RB49NCEXQWFCH 1 can not be used for cellphone conversationsbr a major echo problembr the whole reason why i purchased em in the first placebr ahhhhhh man 
39476150_R2VF832HTK5MQZ 4 good price
25946537_RIN4LLVRTR5YX 5 cool i love this case works perfectly
48571573_R3SBEGU4HVKBIT 1 broke the first day returned
7136409_R20BB65E6GXLT7 5 all good a
46176991_R3DL6FM74C3B8U 1 i ordered one and it was defective  would not work at all i ordered second to give it another try and its not working dont waste time and effort
46077843_R13OUJELBGW850 5 these look feel and perform like new
5005564_R1KRK5HVIFBCGH 5 all aspects of the player work very well records play smooth and clear instructions are very simple the price is definitely worth it
905664_RKES9SFH35WZE 5 its very nice
3821718_RRM5ADZL281BD 1 it not good
18100323_RCLJX74V7W2O8 4 good material and quality i am so satisfied with the case and i recomend the product
482964_RH56OXO2HSKQ 4 was a delay however received well
51762043_RFAPLAG9P2KEQ 3 i can see hear why people say these are great for music they really block out outside sounds to provide a good listening experience i would caution against using these as your bluetooth phone headset for exactly the same reason you can certainly hear the person speaking to you just fine and they can hear you clearly as well the problem is that they block out the surrounding sound so well that you cant hear yourself speaking into the phone and so you end up speaking loudly so you can hear what you are saying i am keeping these for listening to music when im on the treadmill which is very noisy and will certainly benefit from the outside noise cancellation ive returned to my motorola headset from the phone
39002756_R1NY24CKGN1UVG 5 excellent quality cables  quick shipping  no problems and anker is my brand
34597626_R13UP8BNHQQXZJ 5 use these to replace the sony mdrwo8s that are no longer manufactured  been using them for several weeks and they are almost as good as the sonys in that they are not quite as comfortable as the sonys but nothing major just think i was used to where the sonys rested in my ears  sound quality is comparable to the sonys  no problems at this time  will purchase again should the need arise
28700337_RKGDR10NJWOH6 1 sound quality was excellent hated the asymmetrical length of the cord the ear buds were attached to neither matters now since they longer convey sound in one ear bud and it is significantly diminished in the other poor craftsmanship and waste of money
46114549_R3R1D512D3QQ50 1 volume control does not work at all
50867800_R2INL7KRN399AL 4 these are great earplugs and fit the most comfortably for my ears ive tried others and these really seal best of course it may not be the case for other people they are very inexpensive and light and i like the cord configuration being a tape rather than a round wire the only problem is that they dont last quite as long and they tend to get static and lose one earplugs connection after a few months i order these by half a dozen because i go through them fast they last about 3 months with my kind of use before one ear goes silent im a heavy user though
170421_R3TCK0S52AP3EL 4 they are very great headphones the best i have owned but there is one little thing that bothers mebr br the cable broke on the inside after the first month have no idea why i untangled it everytime it needed to be untangled and one thing i noticed was that my cat was laying down on the cable she is a very fat cat and broke the adaptor i have went through 2 of those because of cat
20536688_R2MJNRSYFZN16Q 5 earbuds work great  very comfortable and easy to operate will probably purchase a second pair for my husband
28670343_R166UI0P3RP6JA 1 stylish potentially interesting product  dont buy them they are very poorly constructed  look at the auction sites to see the myriad number of people trying to unload them
35839550_R1AUK8AMW1BZ9X 3 everyone is 100 correct about the quality of the ear pieces they sound great and are very functional despite cheap build if you can get them for super cheap then by all means buy them and run them into the ground if you want something built to last keep on searching
6614109_R3N0DCXB3IE3KW 4 its exactly as it was described  its not a hard case and i do feel if something heavy got dropped on it protection may be questionable but for what i need this will do
32428981_R22BWXWS4545Z7 1 they didnt work at all for me  i likely got a defective pair
32755640_R2ZN1N756RP5S 5 5hrs
44126507_R2RMM8RC53NWGU 5 great
46383721_R2ZEVR4E764GUL 1 frustrating  connection i purchased these headphones to use when im working in the yard cutting the grass and other yard work i like to keep my phone in my back pocket when doing this i would set up itunes or spotify and get my playlist going put it in my back pocket and within 2 minutes it starts dropping out and losing its connection to my phone this is extremely frustrating since i either have to finish the task for which i bought this headphones to accompany or stop take off my gloves and get a connection again but this would be every few minutes i emailed amazon and they immediately offered to replace them at no charge i made the exchange and had a brand new pair i tried them and its the same thing also when i play the music with the phone laying on the table in front of me or in my hand closer to the headphones its perfectly fine its just when its in my back pocket and i dont have a metal hip or anything that was with the iphone 5s i thought maybe it was old phone technology so i upgraded to the latest at the time iphone 6s with my fingers crossed no luck the same thing it drops out and disconnects when in my back pocket it is some better but not much when in my front pocket i know some may say 34well then just put it in your front pocket thats not the point its more comfortable to keep it in my back pocket doing that kind of work and its only 3634 max from the headphones it should work  sound quality i had been using the bose wired ear buds before purchasing the beats wireless ear buds the bose wired have some amazing sound for ear buds with the bose the lows are really deep and full not so with the beats though the lows are tinny at best and when i contacted beats they suggested i try different ear pieces i tried all they supplied plus purchased aftermarket ones to try i dont have abnormally shaped ears and any other ear buds always fit fine even the hard plastic non conforming apple ear buds the only way to get good full sound from my beats was to press them into my ears where it almost hurt  these now have been sitting on my shelf in the case for the last 6 months not used while i wait for another option to come out its a shame that a 200 set of headphones has this many issues that a company like beats and apple cant figure out  note to beats yes  i would take another pair or upgraded pair to try for free just contact me with the offer
40149595_RLF3U6Z080F46 5 love this great way to boost my ipod volume and improve sound quality also used this my laptop was quick easy to install  plug and play  to reduce then line noise coming out to speakers when giving presentations some indicate problem with control setting knob i had no issue with the settings the directions were a bit lacking in guidance however visited the website for fiio
9769071_R35E54IM5EQ1ZF 4 so far this headset has turned out to be very good  sounds is good they are comfortable to wear and the cord does a pretty good job of staying tangle free  my only two minor complaints are that it does take a little work to get them to sit in my ear snugly and the plug fits very snugly into the jack so i have to be careful to make sure its fully inserted otherwise the mic does not work
12202037_R9REAQ2U7WXIC 4 the kids really prefer it to earbuds when on my desktop computer i find that it is useful there too and has good sound
26743344_R17AH3OQQVTGCO 5 best headphones for the money
44170311_R1PAP731DOL3EB 5 seems well made and solid drives my headphones much better than my ipod i dont use my ipod on the go so this is a perfect addition please read the instructions to verify that it is configured properly rather than just plug it in and go there was no issue with mine but better safe than sorry also to remove the bottom cover remove the two lower screws on the front and rear plates and the bottom pulls off i had the initial hum and hiss but that cleared up with the first turn on with no signal feeding the amp i can turn the volume to full and the amp is quiet very happy with the way the amp sounds
5674917_R2MXY6S6QZO7G5 4 the only bad thing i could say about this is that the cord isnt very long i didnt think it would be a big deal until i used them but i still like them
50415388_RQM3Q6FBME1OT 5 work great and cancel out background noises connects to ipads easily
45365589_R1XN3KJFOG7VOO 4 works well
21536366_R2BVDFHGZAKZ7T 5 probably the best product ever made for audio work just watch any mobile audio producer wear this product it tells you these are the finest headphones made 
32002759_R1RPHO5R8D69O4 5 great item
4355573_R1KWU5CIE46C91 5 really good quality earbuds for a cheap price
26083416_R3QEJX72561T8J 5 sound great
31797372_R3C8L2B8OUNV7S 5 finally can understand english and scottish dialogue on pbs shows these are great and no disturbing others
1864193_RJYAV9TAMQJ19 1 it hurts my ears
47813074_R2LPZWRY0OSXN6 4 sounds are balanced well but dont expect bass and buy it clear voice and good microphone for calling
22281623_R2MYQXWDJPCL0W 5 i got this yesterday and after i charged it for 2 hours i used it the whole time with no problem at all i also used it when i watched movies in bed and i didnt even have to worry about the cords connected thru the phone because theres none im glad i got this and i will definitely purchase this again for gifts thank you
1043436_R3GZIT9JVAN47H 5 wonderfully packaged  in a very nice box very good quality foam that turns very comfortable when using my phones
222881_R1OH4W69Z5MFGQ 5 good quality
33585868_R3MPZA5IJ3Q26U 5 yes buy the case for the sentey headphones i debated on if the case was necessary but i am so happy i bought the case i have 2 cases and 2 sets of the headphones now the cases make travel and storage without damage or cord strain so much easier
9919870_R2V47DZJGOVDO7 4 have trouble hearing left speakers sometimesand only when using this particular cord
50181953_R6FMDRLBWG4YU 5 the best earphones ever
19338286_R11TEI2NHJNBXG 4 i like the smooth sound but their website is not much helpful
18490657_R1HVGI6T1RZPEL 1 i have had several pairs of the aftershokz headphone both the bluetooth and wired i love the design and the feel but they just do not last the battery dies and wont recharge one of the speakers stops working the controls quit working or they  just wont accept a charge im through with them after four pairsbr however the company is great they will replace your headphones without any hassle still i want something that no only works but keeps working
8070871_R2RLV9G2M6C7OV 5 i like it very much
7801054_R1ZM3EVPKSY49Z 4 i really enjoy how compact the headphones can get when travelling can just fold them and stick them in my bag works great on computerstabletsphones sometimes the mic needs to be close or facing towards the mouth for others on call to hear you but otherwise its okay and nice the low price was also a plus
39949207_R3HRJ1NZJGFF3Z 5 plenty of wire length im 6 feet tall and drop my mobile into my usually deep pants pocket miccontrol  is positioned low enough to find easily yet mic output is strong and clear control is big and easy to use ear buds are comfortable but stay put phone operation includes answer mute and hangup music operation one tap startspauses playback two skips to next song three   audio quality of earbuds is very good  rivals that of my bose buds no battery to worry about because it physically plugs into the phone you are ensured that mics built into phones are disconnected some combinations of phone and bluetooth headsets leave the phones mics on such that pocket noise drowns out the bts mic
43869013_R31PUMIGY16959 4 these are basically quite good overall very nicely balanced sound id prefer a little more rumble in the low bass however with good detail and presence these have a less aggressive treble than the new momentum inears which is the one argument many people make against sennheisers newest model the momentums however arguably have a tiny edge in clarity and presence  im a big guy with pretty big ears and it takes extra effort to push these into my ear as far as necessary to get a good seal which you need to get good bass but i was able to get them to work  for more powerful low bass along with good sound try the velodyne vpulse smooth and musical but not as detailed or the philips tx1 or tx2 if you can find them
36924150_R1RR4BOX30BGNG 5 i travel all the time with myriad cords  this helps me keep free of the tangle  awesome and innovative
40670466_R10RD2031NDYVQ 3 to pricey
38393163_R1BG9KIJMNZHK8 5 works great
16866957_R3PX42ULF62BSE 5 works well
19888376_R13QPJPMLNB98L 1 good idea but total garbage  bought these for my son and they worked initially but 5 weeks later 1 week past the return window they stopped working  be warnedthey wont last and  25 its a complete ripoff
11708903_R1DQSKBPU1C5D4 5 very good
19661451_R2HRAXX052E328 4 definatly gets the job done sucks i cant remove the cord built in but oh well
34784978_R2KW9AWJ1JI87B 4 good sound for the small price
45141610_R2NI0YDUO5PGQQ 3 they are okay but dont make a perfect connect to our surface 2  if you dont align just right can lose sound or picture
10668203_R2DAFRTD2U7E80 5 i love it  its perfect
51849187_R35046GDJHYX18 5 i really like these headphones  i am using them with a samsung s6  they sound good and stay on my head  so far they have not gone dead after the initial charge  i believe that ive used them for about 3 hours so far without recharging
11799956_R1M8KU6XHV9IA6 5 i love how its very portable and the mic to this works well unlike several over headsets i got this doesnt distort my voice or make me a mute
12405061_R29XYDD4H66HKN 5 good
114435_R1QU6HODKASI21 5 i love these headsets very easy to use good sound and light weight on my head good buy for the money highly recommend them
16040521_R33UHZK83RP49I 2 good sound but lousy microphone a lot of money to spend for good looking and great sounding headphones not to mention the allure of the bose name at the end of the day however i can get good sound and a better microphone from a lesser known brand at a quarter of the price disappointing
7446701_R35LGCHI7A4HK2 4 they feel nice and fit well but they change the sound of my athm50s quite a bit
38027643_RBVMPL8LNHUV0 1 the sound is terrible the 100  is a lie  when i listen to my music it sounds too glitchy and echoy waste of 20 bucks would not recommend
848673_ROY9LAX1KOVRB 5 looks great and works perfectly just be aware that you need to take special care of it i didnt with mine and time kind of affects it visually
1011322_R1KCE1XF4RWW65 5 i love it very comfortable true to color loud and clear sound excellent quality for a low price
44969049_R2JWSLGM94OGLF 1 sound quality was good but very delicate and didnt lost not even a week waste of money
915813_R1SGT70WENEDIH 1 while the sound quality was good my happiness was shortlived once i discovered that my microphone wasnt working with android phone what kind of manufacturer makes a product not compatible with androidbr br returning it at the first opportunity
34437582_R122FTBSKYVUPL 1 i am not unfamiliar with jvc earphones and maybe i just didnt have anything better to compare them to but in the past they sounded pretty goodbr this headphone however was crappy it is the second set of bt headphones i ordered in a week intended for work while the other one from a different brand stayed at home waste of money i cant even begin to organize this review i was so disappointed i usually order prime and this was not but because i thought jvc would provide me a certain minimum quality sound i went for it huge regret it sounded distorted even without my other headset to compare it to there was pleanty of static noise and the sound was weak i seriously thought the item was defective still do since another reviewer rated this a 5 and the seller requested that i work it out with jvc no not gonna waste my time and even though return shipping is not free id rather pay it than go through all that hassle so lesson 1 dont buy a product that is not well reviewed my review is only the 2nd as far as i know and lesson 2 always buy prime especially for items that you are trying for the first time
38359323_R46KUT9KG97M2 5 good
6215754_RWKTHEDJ6ZO7S 5 it works on my surface 
36224976_R3605OUWSDE553 1 too big for my head and there is no way to adjust the size
21211612_R2ZL3WC66SGHK 5 i bought this for my husband whom loves to go hiking and running and he keeps thanking me for thishe especially enjoys the fact that it is a bluetooth and has no problem with the cord getting on his wayi received this product at a discount rate for my honest review
38953131_R2QITH6TW0T1PE 5 could do with out them we have 3 pair all are great
44840158_R1OU0BJ5OF61NI 1 i ordered these for my nephew he was so excited when they finally arrived  two days later one earbud just fell apart i was with him and he didnt do anything rough just started to unwind them to show them to me extremely disappointed
49718558_R28T8NRZ3PERXG 5 look no further these earbuds are amazing  i am a dancer therefore needed a pair of earbuds that would fit comfortably and stay in during extreme movement head whipping and thrashing upside down and the works  these do not hurt my ears at all after long periods of time like most ive tried nor do they even begin to fall out with movement  i did so much research before getting these looked at all the 34top 10 sport wireless earbuds34 and went through about 6 pairs of the 34best of the best34 and returned them all before falling upon these  it is possible that the super expensive ones 100 work just as well because i didnt try any of those but i could care less because these are so much cheaper and i have no issues with them  other pluses all the functions are super easy to use it hasnt cut out on me yet they have great sound the battery lasts longer than most earbuds you can use them while charging not all have this option you might not think of this factor but its useful you are able to form them to your ear so id presume their great fit would apply to lots of people and not just my ear type  bottom line  if youre going to be doing some serious athletics these are definitely the earbuds for you you dont have to try a bunch because ive already done the work for you i couldnt be happier with my purchase 
24368154_R2PMBG5GLST52 5 came through with what he promised the beats are dope and as if they were new
43021248_R344JMWTRDFAHM 4 these headphones are great but are not indestructible  weve been through a few pairs with two kids but if they are taken care of they will last a long time  they fit well and have good volume control  however not completely immune to two year old tantrums  that being said they are the best kid headphones ive purchased
6182075_R3T7FG0VSUN63E 2 volume control does not consistently work  great response to send a replacement though
12331298_R3C4UTJE9EJ02L 5 if you can get these for less than 100 and your head is smaller than a watermelon bingobr br comfortable  checkbr sounds like insert your favorite attractive artist serenading you  checkbr br have you bought them yet  stop reading this and click add to cartbr br these headphones sound so good they would force charles krauthammer to break dancebr br httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvqtwsyuqyqk
52921837_R24DHDW8O93IAI 5 the case fits my mdr7506 headphones perfectly  i havent put much mileage on it yet but it seems like its well made and will hold up for years to come unlike other reviewers i did not find any odor emanating from the case while i did not realize when i ordered this case that it would come from china it arrived before they said it would overall highly recommended
43040892_R22IFSZFD27W2W 5 great size
40189003_R3X3FUJTBYUWE 4 i bought these headphones based off of the reviews i read on amazon to replace my beats audio powerbeats  compared to the beats audio the sound quality is par when it comes to the highs and mids but for bass the rhas lack that deep punch which the beats had  99 of the time i use the headphones for running and working out and i can say that i need to try out the other ear buds that are supplied especially the memory foam i find myself constantly pushing the buds back into the ear canal due to sweat and the weight of the buds themselves  collectively the headphones are well crafted and i can tell they will last more than 3 years but that comes at a price  they are a little heavier metal vs plastic than the beats  the cord is also a little longer than i would have liked  however my beats only lasted 1 year which is why i bought the rhas with a 3 year warranty you cant go wrong  i have only had these for a short while and i know i will get used to them  i had the same reservations with my beats which replaced a pair of sure earbuds  now let me get back to the audio quality  i miss the added bass when i am running but if you just use the buds as headphones in lieu of the apple ear buds these are great  there are songs that i have listened to for years and heard notes i have never heard before  all in all these are one of the better headphones on the market but this is my personal opinion  i bought them based on audio reviews and the awesome warranty would i buy them again  probably not since there will most likely be a better and lighter product on the market in 3 years
22919947_RGX9U9V7A7SLE 4 worked well just a little stiff
22716337_R3CEPT8LJ648ZH 5 my daughter loves these and wears them around the house like a headband shes 2
50845759_R1JD0FF31UIP9C 1 terrible first time wearing them the volume switch casing fell off leaving all the wiring exposed ive taped it together again and i can still get sound out of the right earphone but there is a copper wire sticking out these feel like a cheap copy the shipping package  was skippy at best apple products are well encased these earphones were in a plastic baggy then placed loose in a mailing envelope
44192866_R1HYVU039LE4YK 1 not good
2241388_R2M5WTKRF77MY6 1 broke after one use
45081806_R277ZMSE4I5BO3 4 does what it states  my only concern would be the durability as the product is mostly made of plastic
34370236_R2EV6NOXAMIK37 5 these are the best earbuds i have ever had and give my over the ear headphones a run for the money
22890690_R22910Q4MZTMN0 5 cute
42138685_R1ZM5JC9AHKMHE 4 product was provided in exchange for an ubiased reviewbr br these headphones are excellent for the price  i have a pair of sol bluetooth headphones and these are right up there with the quality in sound and build  they come with a great travel case microusb and aux cords  they are lightweight and very stylish  i was skeptical before receiving them but i am now a fan  the ear pieces swivel nicely for maximum fit and comfort  i have worn these for a minimum of eight hours per day for a few days while working without any hiccupsbr br for the price i dont think you will get much better  definitely has the feel and sound quality of much more expensive pair
10330809_RTEQQ8LNYDPE 3 doesnt work as well as geekbok have to be in extremely close range or terrible interference distrupts call
24157438_RC09P583IV83V 5 stay in my ears great with the large size did not think i have large ears but i guess for this product i do good for phone calls while typing cooking or doing other work
11588181_R3FHJ8EWKTR4XP 5 excellent traffic sound
14121933_R2I1FXBXFPTOJY 3 got these for my beats to replace the ones that fell offdont quite fit perfectly but they stay on and they are the color i wanted
16463365_R34JH7MM3L6ZDV 5 amazingok first what is the definition of amazing  inspiring awe or admiration or wonder  thats exactly what i got with these headphonesbr br im no musician or technical expert when it comes to sound  i guess we are all different have different ears music preferences even settings on our ipods cell phones or hifis it all makes a difference to the quality and production of the sound  so my opinion of these headphones is obviously based on my preferencesbr br i have owned many headphones  last year i was on a mission to find the best for the buck from 9 ear buds to over the ear headphones for 200  these sony mdrv6s are without doubt the best by a loooooooong way  amazon had a 12 hour sale on these bad boys sale price 55  i couldnt say no  i had already reviewed these and the sony 7506 same headphones a long time ago when i saw the 55 price i jumped on itbr br they arrived within the week  well packaged nice box with red velvet cloth carry bag and the actual coiled cord has the 35mm connector but you get the 65mm adapter as well  not gold  they fit my head very comfortably  so enough about the headphonesyou know its a sony product and youll get quality  now for the sound br br i like all types of music except rap and maybe hiphop  my fav is more along the lines of depeche mode fusion coffee shop musicwith a little pink floyd yes acdc and many many others  anywaythe soundbr br first the loudness  ive read many reviews about these headphones and people made comments that they used an amplifier i honestly dont see the need yet  they are plenty loud  i use an ipod 6th gen and have the volume at 34 or 75 and its loud  yes you could use an amp and ramp up the volume but right now for me i dont see the point  the actual quality of sound blew me away from the very first song  omg  i cant begin to explain the quality of sound  people have reviewed that these headphones do not bloat the bass or put shine on the treble and i believe they are right  the sound seems very true very sure very real   and very perfect   and you really do hear things youve never heard before  as ive said ive used beats sennheisers jvc bose but for whatever technical reasons sony have done something magical hereits insane at how clear and crisp the sound is  its like when you close your eyes you can swim around the instruments because you can hear them individually playing  then when youre focusing on one instruments sound you pick up on another and another and another  imagine being in a candy shop for the first time in yearsyour senses just go wildbr br you absolutely can not go wrong with these headphones  i have them on nowdepeche mode behind the wheel  if you see these on sale for 55get them  i wish i got 2 pair  these are without doubt my new go too headphones  now i know what the fuss is about all the reviews and why they have 45 starspeople have reviewed that these headphones do not bloat the bass or put shine on the treble and i believe they are right  the sound seems very true very sure very real   and very perfect   and you really do hear things youve never heard before  as ive said ive used beats sennheisers jvc bose but for whatever technical reasons sony have done something magical hereits insane at how clear and crisp the sound is  its like when you close your eyes you can swim around the instruments because you can hear them individually playing  then when youre focusing on one instruments sound you pick up on another and another and another  imagine being in a candy shop for the first time in yearsyour senses just go wildbr br you absolutely can not go wrong with these headphones  i have them on nowdepeche mode behind the wheel  if you see these on sale for 55get them  i wish i got 2 pair  these are without doubt my new go too headphones  now i know what the fuss is about all the reviews and why they have 45 stars
579955_R1ASLY0LV08915 5 great item husband is hard of hearing and he can turn the volume up as loud as he wants and i can have the tv on at a lower volume  it keeps us both happy love it
32408174_R1XBT9Z3DGIPIE 5 these are now my standard earbud they last me about a year with heavy usage and many encounters with fixed objects and dogs who pull them out of my ears which is at least double the amount of time other earbuds have lasted mebr br the tip choices include ones large enough for my ears and are comfortable they are very efficient requiring very little volume to drive them they are somewhat bassheavy which is fine with me and the treble isnt tinny or shrillbr br  they are the best sounding most reliable earbuds ive found at a price im willing to pay i like them a lot and will continue to buy them
26375607_R1VC5UBN2VWJ8V 5 love these headphones they are amazing and they sounds great they sound great for techno music and stay put while working out
8260686_R1TK3SLP5SPAQO 3 the product is good but you can know after a couple of months that they are cheap materials
13179011_R2ZE0XSWU4S799 5 i use a work van that is about as noisy an environment as there is this buds work well and they dont get in the way since they are bluetooth
18347084_RUOFZ8LVHQRPI 5 works very well
44848386_R2CI7UQGRQYZ0I 5 easy to install and easy to use im loaded with audio technica equipment so i figured the best addition to everything was an audio technica accessory instead of resting my headphones on top of my dusty computer case i now have it hanging nicely at the edge of my table my table is linnmon from ikea this clamp works with it just finee my only wish is that it could be used with the hook not sticking out of the table but sticking under it but its fine it looks really nice and feels sturdy 5 stars
45381100_R3UYWZXANTSZTT 5 these only work to pick up tv reception if you own a higher end tv  they work amazing on both my 4634 rca hd tv and 4234 vizio but not at all on the inexpensive 4234 hd tv i bought from walmart an emerson i believe or some offbrand they will pick up only fm radio from the cheap tv  the cheap tvs work great as tvs but something about them lacks what is necessary to pick up wireless reception from the tower transmitter as most who purchased this item know the fm receiver is in the headphones itself and picks up whether the tower is turned on or off so this word of advice unless you own a higher end tv eg  rca sony lg vizio  do not purchase these because they wont work
30544371_R1I45LU0I7C57D 3 i got these because i had been using inear headphones and decided that i didnt want to go deaf for the price they are amazing they block out some noise and sit pretty comfortably over the ears
28261195_R283RDRESF0NE9 5 works great sounds great good quality does what it needs to do
13493638_R3F6WQUJ5QFF3Y 4 good ones
41532314_R1RD7DZ15TK4VH 5 great headphones  i walk 5 miles a day and i love having music the whole time  they are a great value for the price  it took me a month of walking to completely listen to all my songs  highly recommend these for exercise yard work etc
11376489_R326494INEV41R 5 pretty sweet they also make a mean wireless keyboard
50148877_R31FMIB7F6F2L9 3 very uncomfortable in my ears
46537727_RIUV0XZ06Y16L 4 nice ear buds at a great price
21521893_R6BFNDOOCY2F3 3 the sound quality is as good as the earbuds these were replacing  the build quality is nice  the one and only issue i had was that it is extremely difficult to change the rubber earbud covers  it comes with 3 sizes with the medium sized ones already installed  i wanted to change them out for the large ones  however they are built in such a way that they dont just slip on and off  i found the hard way that you have to stretch them around the plastic earbud and doing so is a lot easier said than done  i ended up ripping both of the large covers and struggled for about 10 minutes to get the medium ones back on  i found it is easier if you stretch them around something slightly bigger than the earbud like the tip of a pen and then slide them on  however since ive ruined the large covers they keep sliding out of my ears
41669220_R13GKEHISJDAIT 5 great product good sound  i use them for all kinds of workouts insanity running etc
882122_R2XDYCH7SUS9TN 5 by far the best earphones ive bought a lot of my work revolves around music and theyre well worth the price
21911303_RNNM201GOBUPJ 5 have bought 2 pair of these now for my sister she lost the first pair after over a year and a half but absolutely loves them she disliked all in ear phones before trying these i cant say much else as i wasnt directly using them but they held up to a middle school kids abuse for a long time so for a reasonable price they cant be beat in my opinion
43073855_R2AVEDTAYT86O8 1 i have to send it back just the right was working
23155767_R2WD694TKYRDY 2 after searching and reading reviews i ordered these headphones for my 5 year old son hes very careful with them and takes care when using them with his ipad to watch movies or play games a little after 30 days the headphones stopped working we were on our way home from a road trip and he plugged them in and nothing no sound no anything i tried them with other devices and had the same results so frustrating that i cannot return them i would not recommend buying these headphones when there are so many other options out there
33540461_R2CDFE6LDGQ1TW 4 very good replacment for the motorola hk250 bluetooth i bought this for a coworker and she is still thanking me
6870726_R34MW1C6PO8TT1 5 exactly what i expected and worked perfectly
136937_R14PRIMITE1G7V 5 great sound and comfortable feelfit for the price expectations were exceeded
4021512_R1X6QQEKC208NL 1 so far have had two sent to me first ones broke after one daybr volume in right ear was way lower then left ear so i got a replacementbr lasted a few days until the left ear volume went lower then right not sure if i should get a refund or replacement
4031957_RIZL7EKW0ZO02 5 great headphones theyre inexpensive but very good quality pretty comfortable on the ears and seem very durable so far have been using them for a few months and even if they break in a year i will probably just buy this pair again
131246_RY9K4AZT7KDAF 5 no big surprise just common expectation enough for me
21548829_R2Q284BL7CTFEV 2 the sound quality was good but the item durability was not a slight bump resulted in the jack partially snapping from the cord the second time the headphones were plugged into an airline armrest jack and sound only came out of one side i dont recommend buying these headphones cheap construction
3242303_RLFJUYJBFF38V 5 these are the best headphones i own they feel very light on your head and the padding is excellent
43240288_R3164MHAUUL20M 5 airy soundstage sparkly treble slightly lush mids neutral bass comfort great looking serious bang for the buck for the price these are spot on and simply a great deal if you are wanting an entry into audiophile territory
44063863_R13OTOISJZCK9G 2 didnt impress me  i wanted something with good quality sound for my desktop computer but apparently these are more for cellphones  sounded really tinny on the computer not worth the price  returned it for a refund
35160198_R2IXMZP0MTHQ8T 5 im a hater of inear headphones they have small drivers terrible sound output and usually break on me fast these headphones were everything my other inear headphones werent they have great bass with absolutely wonderful 40mm drivers they allow ambient sound to come in and comfortable for my runs their sweat proof and slipproof design work well and are comfortable for heavy workouts or activity i have not washed the ear pieces yet gross right but supposedly they can be unclipped from the headphone and laundered the kevlar cord protects the headphones from shorts during hard physical activitybr br it was tough to find a headphone i liked but these are them
13310981_R2I5TOEXON4MJN 5 they sound amazing and they were only 15
12415313_R2L0W19XVDEXDV 5 ive bought one pair of earbuds after another and even the ones that claim they work in little ears just pop out of mine or sliiiiide out really slowly and tickle as they go these fit and stay in when i use the smallest size tip ive bought three setsbr br they saved me on a recent transatlantic flight that was apparently some sort of shipping container for screaming kids i almost dont want to review them here because im afraid you will buy them all but theyre that perfect for itty bitty earholes
52326327_R13746QRTB0KE8 2 these were great when i started using them 4 weeks ago sound was good stayed in my ears while i was swimming however as is the way with many 34waterproof34 headphones they stopped working after a short time 4 weeks to be exact im not hard on headphones and never need to replace non waterproof headphones
768780_R30VTKS2KE69WP 4 they work good from reading the reviews i did see a lot of different things and in the end i had high expectations for this item sound wise because visually they are not the bestbr br they sound good i was not blown away too much but i do like them and i will be buying more pairs for my studio
16564290_RONAI4AL8UHJ8 4 great radio i am happy with it
34415169_R1CMQYO1ZDGDWV 4 these fit my jaybird bluebudx as advertised not as comfortable as the foam originals but a great value
13044898_R2ELEJJ9VOSONT 1 i received this today and eagerly plugged it in and ran my setup wizard for my voice chat client all sound was directed into the left ear only and the microphone did not work at all save your money and buy something else if youre looking to replace a damaged micheadphone splitter im going to keep looking myself
28373264_R39RHCOINQ4W60 3 i loved these headphones when i first got them they stayed in place while running were great for lifting because i didnt have the cord hanging all over sound was great volume was good etc however after about a month of sweaty workouts the casing of the volume controls came apart support was great and i was sent a replacement right away i thought maybe the combination of me having very sweaty workouts and leaving them in the car with the heat may have caused that to happen so on my second pair i made sure to wipe them down after every workout and never leave them in the car well this is my second pair and all of sudden the volume wasnt working again same thing is happening the volume control case is coming apart i wish they would make these truly sweatproof i want to try to put some silicone or something on there to keep it waterproof but i think it may void the warranty i recommend them if youre not a big sweaterbut i do hard workout and they havent been so great they only get 3 stars because of the service
21914192_R2Z5W253MXPN86 5 this product is of excellent quality  it works flawlessly with my iphone sound quality is outstanding  most importantly very comfortable i use them for hours at a time  this is one of those devices that just work and you never even think about it that is until the manufacturer contacted me sometime after my purchase to ask me how i liked the product  impressive customer servicebr br imagine a company that produces customer reviews by actually engaging their customers  this company is on the rise
1979369_R18G207OMPATGW 5 bought it as a gift and he takes it everywhere mows the lawn with almost no sound interference from mower soft ear pads so great for flying so u can still rest your head foldable and came with a casepouch
344131_R287ZSNZBUGGEI 4 i like the way it looks how you here from it but i did not like how when i accidentally hit the headphones a little barely it started to make a noise that is not a good noise at all it make me shiver and after a while it hurts my ear
28915257_R18MCJT34VEOIG 5 good quality ear buds
47433859_R3V59RXRSQWJZH 5 awesome
43141421_R3RJP94O8DO6B2 5 cheap and work well and fit my tiny ears not all earbuds do but these actually fit and stay without me having to order extra small caps  had these before and bought again after losing my first pair  they also seem to last longer than other brands ive had not sure if its a coincidence or the product
44074651_R17LYIQ6L6MFEU 5 just what i needed to use the internal speaker on my dell monitor and a good pair of external speakers first shippingfrom china already  price was very inexpensive
28483952_R3B6INEP5LTU6Q 5 listen to music and still not miss callsbr br what a great pair of headphones for the price excellent sound and extremely comfortable to wear you can answer and hang up calls too i did check for noise cancellation and it is really good in that aspectbr br this is one of my favorite headphone noise cancellation is great and the bass and treble is awesome i was skeptical when i bought it cause i thought itll be just a basic nothing special earphone ive had earphones but their bass is not as good as this one it looks like a basic earphone but they sound quality is great for me i like the flat sleek cord the rubber material they used on the cord feels good good quality for the pricebr br i would recommend this product as a value for the price i did receive a slight discount for honest feedback  if you are in the market this product could work well for you you wont regret buying these i assure you
41374797_R17NQRQVRMXDKB 5 really nice and my son loves them
435751_RBNEX0EQQNSOS 5 got these for my father in law as a gift for when he works out he absolutely loves them he said theyre very light weight cool look and the sound is excellent tried them myself and they are just that great look too
1782421_R29PZUI0XIBFE 5 i personally found these easy to use it was between these or the jaybird blubuds x for me i choose these for the over ear hooks but that was my preference though they are convenient to use and i have faced no problems yet
50985871_R1PVWA6IZNP589 4 works like a champ my kids love to hook up together and play music or games
14852823_R3A24JWM9ZFO1F 5 i was looking for some new ear buds mostly to play handheld games or listen to music i did some research and found these listed on several articles as a quality choice for the price ive only used them a few times but they are very comfortable and the sound quality is great i love the aesthetic wooden ear pieces choice of ear bud color nylon cord and cloth carry bag make these a cut above the rest
12440214_RHZWYEP46JQH 4 i have the headset for work and pads were worn out  headset discontinued  glad i found then on amazon  feel great
13310981_R27E8XY1EWXJCB 4 sound great but they are a little quiet compared to other earbuds i own
166561_RTK8EZ9EZUTM0 1 this head set has only one plus point that is good estheticsperformance is very poor call clearance is terribleand its not stable in my earsfr every minute i need to adjust this in my ears as it is slips off frm my earsi got sm 6 sets of earbud of three sizes nt even one is properif i have spended another 10 extra i would hv get beats headphones
49565726_R2KEXM553IM2A9 5 received these to write a review these are quite good no lag when watching a video on youtube easy to pair with phone  dont cut out i would recommend these
8868740_R30Y9KJRF21HLB 5 superb
37712631_R1WTBYK1G5WWPV 2 disappointed  the wire is fickle and needs to be pulled out half way to get the volume loud  i have no idea why  when its pulled out half way it sounds awesome  great great great sound with the wire half way out but i wanted the wireless feature most  however once the wire is out the sound fades away and no button will increase volume  its awful  the controls  only work as a skip feature not as volume control  i have to reach for the phone to control volume on bluetooth which defeats the point  highly disappointed  i have no idea if its the product wire or what but i am returning this
17153277_R33797X1SNT66Z 5 awesome love having the volume control on the wires and the design to fit in your ear is so comfy they do get a bit scratched up a bit with extended use but i wear them practically 247
52791616_R1OIIS2R8WXZVL 4 reasonably priced bluetooth receivertransmitter i am using to go between my desktop computer located in my office and my denon receiver approx 30ft away in the living room to play music  audio quality is acceptable but there is some loss from the original  tried using my sony 400 disc cd changer as the source as well with similar relative quality degradation  loss is not to a level that causes it to be unlistenable but slightly muddier than the source materialbr unit offers better range than one from another manufacturer that i tried previously but being bluetooth still has issues cutting out when objects are in the path of or people walk between trabsmitter and receiver but was able to maintain connection to the pc except and resume play in cases when the signal was interupted for extended periods 30 sec or morebr the ability to run off of usb power instead of just the rechargable battery enabled me to utilize the power outlet on the rear of my receiver and leave it plugged in all the time without worrying about extra cords or it not being chargedbr one detail that would be helpful to improve would be better indication of the tx and rx positions on the switch which are difficult to see as they are raised molded letters that are the same color as the switch itselfbr overall a good piece of hardware that is flexible as both a tranmitter and receiver
19904408_R2PJCZYS67S9X2 5 wow just wowbr these are amazing near perfect sound quality also really useful them being loud and spot on when i dj prefer these over all my older ones which include the legendary pioneer hdj 2000k which actually broke in the studio was my own fault though but these are tough as nails when they say its millitary grade theyre completely right the other day i stood yeah like feet and stuff on these and theyre still fine the cups just popped back on still i dont recommend standing on anything made for producing sound this averted a major crisis comfort wise near amazing the only thing bothering me are the plastic meshes protecting the drivers after a while you feel them sitting against your ears but still 55 amazing and for this price so much better happy listening
21330406_R3OVAVE5OTISLN 3 these headphones do the trick but theyre fake they werent produced by beats and there are multiple indications
14953613_R1W2K1MHWQ9TU 5 this was an impulse buy when i saw them on flash sale could not be happier with them
11703515_R6M5JMCOJ6V9A 4 headphones are a little heavy but the sound is good especially for the price  comes with 2 audio cables one has an inline mic i havent tried out the mic to test the quality yet
29706281_RL77PNTGS9I3L 2 very nice while they are working  i received a pair  from my wife for my  birthday and was thrilled with the performance and comfort  i only wore them at my desk and they were effective at eliminating ambient noise and are far more comfortable than headphones  if you care to use the microphone that is built in there are several providers of 35mm 3 channel usb connectors that make this setup a breeze for using in computer communicationbr br they were perfect for the 5 months until one earbud split on the glue stream and started screeching unpredictably  bose replaced them under warranty my wife ordered them direct from bose  the replacement set lasted 6 mos  same end result bose replaced them again but basically told me that they were weeks from being out of warranty iow  dont call us for another setbr br 4 mos later  failure number threebr br i have to say that i loved them but 300 us per year for earbuds  i dont think so bose  hopefully someone who is not quite so greedy will design something similar that is more durable and less expensive  i would gladly pay 150 per year for the comfort and effectiveness  when you pay 300 for earbuds  you expect quality and durability  bose quiet comfort 20 acoustic noise cancelling earbuds miss the mark on durability
42365527_R3C822D6JPMN9Y 2 i used to think sony mdrs were top of the heap but these cheap headphones dont hold a candle to my bose qc15s i got them for 50 on sale and still they sent even a good dealbr br unimpressive awkward and muddy sounding head gear return
47639206_R1BXWH7WQZSTL9 5 again the grand kids always in need off a cable for their game they are very happy with it
29787483_R18A45S54UDIVD 2 does not stay in my ears for beans and are fairly uncomfortable  it may be that my ears are an odd size but they do not work well for me or stay put when running
739488_RLHIMQZ98WYGG 5 they are not only comfortable but they are by far the best at staying in my ears while running the track the quality is good too and has very good bass i loved these so much i had to buy a second pair if youre looking to buy a good pair of earbuds without breaking the bank then i suggest these
32724206_R1KHPE08R4ZVKE 4 my granddaughter loved it but it only last eight months and i ended up buying her another one from best buy
41577491_R7WT3BRCQ40Y7 3 these have decent sound quality for the price unfortunately they were too large for my head and kept slipping down off my ears  they are also make mostly of plasm which makes a cheap sounding creak when adjusting them  if you have a large head and are looking for a budget set of headphones these could work fine
10331686_R2BMH215HB4UR3 4 i love these headphones at this price point they should include a shorter cable its an easy fix but thats an extra i would have been willing to pay if they were included
46201410_RG6RLI0QE9AQD 4 good fit stays in place when working out wish the sound was louder but other than that good product
16614065_R2ZC9AR5AOEHQ8 3 they are ok
22572006_R3R4AAZF1RZ89H 5 bought these for my husband and he really likes them he uses them everyday and no complaints
780994_R7IDU6PXDDK9Q 5 the seller provide a cable which can connect the other deviceslove it
12855749_RGYY2NVTRFLA0 3 they look pretty cute but the fit is a little weird and the sound isnt as good as canal phones  these are definitely better than the standard iphoneipod earbuds but what isnt  probably not worth the high price
52180655_R3VDA9NEJ4KBFR 5 excellent transaction  well worth the price
44242084_R1PFFWG2WQOOG2 5 great price and quality product
12291797_R32FH5FGWZJD5D 2 the volume control rang is too small
8756654_R34YGAD4JG4DQZ 5 ive read a lot of reviews regarding the lack of bass coming fromout of these phones try an amplifier and youll hear the footsteps of an elephant marching on plywood you wont keep these babies strapped to those flaps on the side of your head everybodys different hell i can hear ant marching to the sugar bowl buddy everybodys hearing ability is not the same
32315613_R3968GYTSY8BV4 3 pros light weight it stays in my ears and the sound quality is not to badbr br cons people say that i sound like im in the bathroom and the bluetooth can get a bit choppy here and therebr br overall i like it better than the lg bluetooth that i had id buy this again
19627441_R2AULYXTX9J5Z0 5 easy to use simple to connect bluetooth so no extra wires and sound quality not too bad also what more could you want
27911601_R3QVALXDI8N3MT 5 if you arent familiar with the brand ghostek you should be first things first the headphones come with a great semihard travel case which i love why spend serious cash on nice headphones only to break them in your bagbr br the headphones are foldable and have a highend solid feel no squeaks or loose parts the brushed aluminum and soft leather components compliment the entire product the head band feels soft and comfortable on my shaved head and the ear pieces fit securely around my ears without leaving any gapsbr br sound quality was crisp and impressive over bluetooth and the included connection cable i tested with an iphone 5 and google music no static or missed lyrics when used as a bluetooth headset for calls the farend caller said i sounded clear but 34on something34 besides my phone meaning a bluetooth device or speakerphonebr br few buttons located on the rear or right headphone all do doubleduty which keeps it easy for completing tasks like ending calls or pausing music playingbr br before reviewing the product i was not that familiar with ghostek after reviewing the product i cant wait to see what else they have in the worksbr product was provided in exchange for an ubiased review
4462619_R2UMW1RG0RJ1Y0 5 money well spent  great bang for your buck so far  fit is great sound is good also and i cannot find anything wrong with them
27383069_RRCZOVZW8MCXJ 5 very good product good design and of excellent quality
7775293_RI3JP3YBTW8GS 5 what a great set of headphones comfortable with plenty of buds for big and small ear holes great big sound with moderate bass not overly heavy but you can feel it and the bass has nice depth call quality is also crystal clear very happy with my purchase also very cute
1083486_R3QL7K5W8O1NO6 5 sounds and feels like a high quality product with a great price
17512437_R27J9IYCB6TFF3 5 these headphones were some of the best ive had unfortunately someone broke them when they borrowed them im going to need to order some more they have great sound quality and no echoing at all
115309_R2TK5FNSKFJB1L 5 works well with any wireless instrumentuse the sd card great for when you dont want to hear your mom
24514126_RBKARLRYJ81N2 1 overall the sound quality is definitely for bassheads and i surely enjoy the 34fun34 sound curve as some describe it as however when i received the headphones the shields were damaged and a small chunk of the headband is missing the postman who delivered it was quite harsh with the packages and dropping it in front of my house with a loud thump possibly damaging the hard drives i just bought too
156091_RGF5UEMPJ4P0K 5 fits perfectly
29139601_R84L9T4Z6F57C 5 these are the best headphones that ive tried in recent years they are actually my first set of bose headphones and i can tell how a lot of people rave about thembr br the headphones fit very comfortably on my head and around my ears there is a r and l printed inside each side so you know which side goes where its easy to adjust the headphones up and down to fit comfortably the sound quality is really excellent the music sounds really clear and the bass is strong but not overwhelmingly sobr br i would highly recommend giving these headphones a try
5749504_R2C53M6UBOAECL 5 loved it the sound is so crisp like the the skullcandy earbuds and lasted me a long time only because i took care of them
36957189_R3J4QP2I3G2GKZ 5 best headphones love love love that they are wireless i hate messing around with cords when i work out
3961833_R32VZWVZ3SRUAD 5 ive had them for about a month and they are very comfortable great sound and never fall out
24748692_RXCCKC696UL6O 5 sister loved these headphones
892866_R2N1DTO7FTLFUR 5 good
31463482_RFL1W50O1SHYX 5 simply awesome
49655367_R24RZHTZ52XT89 5 no more cracking plastic wires
2606359_R1XWPGBZN2RF5I 3 pros tangle free battery lasts for sometime charges fastbr cons hard to fit nicely in ear sound is good but not as nice as nonbluetooth headphones for obvious reasonsbr i enjoy these headphones when working it is efficient to have tanglefree headphones and you can set your phone down somewhere in the room and just do what you want sometimes when im working at strange angles the headphones dont work were talking upside down and sideways here so dont worry too much the sound quality suffers however with the bluetooth connection but not severely these headphones are a pretty good buy for the price
15816384_R3E4QUR9BM6PAL 1 i purchased the wireless power beats 2 because the beats marketing machine got to me and i had to try this phenomenal set of earbuds with the extraordinary base i was so disappointed in the sound quality comfort and cheap plastic looking and feeling construction  i have used bose earbuds for years and can confidently say that the sound quality comfort and construction are superior to what beats is offering if you are like myself and currently use bose earbuds but are curious about this beats phenomenon forget it and stick to what you know and that is bose produces a quality produce that we all expect
50058801_RHKUNQHVXJ3AC 2 decent for the price  however the wires are very flimsy and it took only a couple of months for a break to happen and sound to come out of only one earphone i treated these relatively well because the mic was useful but i am going to get a slightly more robust pair
34664709_R2VXV8SAIV5FB8 1 the material of these headphones are no good it broke on me the second time i used it  the sound quality is sub par as well
1819182_R3HKLE4V4B2WJE 5 great product
52654450_R1K6QP82J3FNTZ 1 in using this product with an iwatch it sounded great when i first syncd paired the headphones but as i went outside on a run the headphones constantly shorted out  the sound was spotty even if i held the device right up to the headphones  it was so bad that i couldnt even maintain pace with a song beat because i would only receive garbled and broken content through the headphones  i bought these because the reviews from so many people were great howeveri do not recommend this product
10561809_R8J26OXZXDCFM 2 not 100 happy  it says compatible with i apple products but im having difficulty  every time i plug them in i have to restart my devices before the headphones work  pretty inconvenient  i do like the volume control for my son thought
49632331_ROY2IS3SZU42U 5 love them 
12421435_RIOQPUNFBE6QE 1 save your money
844789_RPX7BIF2C1DL1 5 as advertisedgreat sounding
17922087_R1SDB2WGJ3XNSG 5 just what we wanted thanks
23029826_R375PRTMFUUSYJ 5 i used to be skeptical about bluetooth earphones  but these are great they have a good sound quality have a long wireless range and is sweat proof really theres no bad thing about it definitely worth the money
34936465_R17DRPR2WVTVJF 2 product did not last long  the sound went out
39011401_R1K5ZZGR479YGJ 2 the second time they were used the volume switch fell apart i got it back together put volume sucked
21421885_R2JU84G1FRRV0P 4 range could be a little better and possible signal strength there are times the phone will be in my pocket and get distorted if i twist the wrong way but typically i have my phone in my backpack or on my arm for running  very pleased overall  for their size they are really loud  not quite as comfortable as some reviews lead me to believe  they took some getting used to and some playing with to find a spot that didnt hurt my hears  but overall very happy especially for the price  i get several hours of bettery too  i actually havent depleted them yet to say how long  i wear them on my bike ride tofrom work running almost every day going to the store walking the dog while im doing housework cooking when im done i just hook them up at one of the many chargers i have around my house for various electronics
35317571_R9CIU8HPNKZNZ 3 i have had these now for about a month or so at first when i read the reviews about these head sets falling off your head i almost did not buy thembr i went ahead anyway well at first they where hurting my ears after a little while big time and i confirmed that they do slide off my head if i bend over a littlebr i was going to turn around and send them back but i adjusted the the tightness over my head by extending them to the max and my ear pain pressure when away they still slide off my headbr why then am i keeping them i like the distance that it still picks up as i walk outside my house my mail box is about 120 feet or more away and it still picks up the signal that is what i like most about this unit i did not want to take a chance on another brand with less rated distancebr another thing my wife is totally jazzed because i have a hearing loss and i no longer have to crank up the volume for my tv so i can hear  so i am putting up with the sliding off my head and living with it i am very active and do a lot of stuff and like listening to the news while i do other stuff around my yard and other areas around my housebr the 4 stars is due to the sliding off my head otherwise i am very happy with this unit
25344824_R1O9PGYDFJO9RQ 5 perfect
182965_RNUUOFNFG17RI 4 perfect
12930585_R1HHYVDIP8XMIJ 5 worked as good as i hoped better than i expected fitnsnug and dont fall out when i run just what i needed and the price is so much more realistic than other brands
125160_R2V0L7170IR9WW 5 my daughter loves her new headphones
36691645_R33ATZV4YYOXNC 5 great seller excellent price quick shipment would repurchase
19830774_R2VK6ERCSMHSFY 2 the earphones are alright dont care for the quality of sound too much but one major inconvenience and annoyance with these are is that the cord is too short buyers please keep in mind that it is much shorter than the regular iphone earbuds
11307918_R3NZ8RKCW4QT0M 4 these earbuds are fantastic  nice bass response and comfortable to wear  i hear nuances of sound that were not there before  great price too
10451666_R1G9JRHJAUJ9XQ 4 good sound quality
24732354_R1WHSPSBGYI8J1 1 didnt use for very long as one ear bud kept cutting out
16016114_R3I9STNW4GQOIK 2 im confused maybe the positive reviews here and elsewhere led me to expect more but i found these to be uncomfortable after less than 30 minutes with sound thats no better than my shure srh440s which also cost about 100 and are comfortable for hours ive heard the audio technica atm 50s or something like that which are about 135 and they absolutely pulverize these things
18861593_R2P6QB8NIKOH8N 5 they automatically adjust the volume so it never gets too loud  great for kids we brought these on a 28 hour road trip for our 25 year old they were the best thing ever i can only listen to 34despicable me34 so many times in a rowbut with these pandas  it was perfect
28272545_R3N9C5STNZABNV 5 love them
23353165_RD54HF16UPSNY 5 perfect for kids to hook onto backpacks for school tough and durable yet easy to open when they need too just what my boys needed
42299517_RRM3GJNMO2ZZY 4 my daughter loves her headphones
22203592_R1D7T1IP7Q2S17 4 these are the best balance of what i wanted the sound is good they connect easily to my devices and dont randomly disconnectthey look great meaning that they are sleek and small they arent distracting that said its a little frustrating that the ear buds dont attach anyplace when i am not using them i have to tuck them under a shirt strap so that they dont hang out and look messy however when i purchased others hoping to remedy this and they were so large and bulky they looked horrible and could not be word with anything without being an eye sore instead of discreet they fit well enough most ear buds are always a bit big or a bit small in my ears never just right the only downfalls are that they are almost to light the slip around a bit i might worry id loose them but havent yet and i have been wearing them for a few weeks the sounds quality is really good if anything i wish they went down in volume just a tiny bit more but by taking one of the ear buds out it fixes that completelybr overall i would recommend them to anyone looking for bluetooth headset these are the third pair ive owned and i prefer them the most
37622888_R15YQXSD8N5SM2 5 superb sound and comfortable even though i have a big head  but you should be prepared for the noise problembr when the builtin amplification is turned on you may well hear intermittent crackling noises if  you are indoors near a wifi connection and if  you plug directly into the headphone jack of a power amplifier or receiver you may hear hum or other noisesbr i called psb and was told this is a known problem arising from the high gain of the builtin electronics the suggested workaround when you use these headphones with a home theater amplifier or receiver turn off the builtin amplification and when you are connected to a portable media source i listen to mp3s saved to my cell phone put the device in airplane mode so it will not pick up rf noisebr both of these workarounds work  not ideal but this is one price you must pay for the really excellent sound of this headsetbr ps i listen mostly to classical music so i want a headset with flat accurate response that is what this headset provides it does sound as psb says like a simply superb speaker system
14711396_RBF2KAJ6I9P2I 2 not effective at blocking noise they are ok as headphones
20412626_R39TLSGOXGZQ3S 2 instead of enhanced bass should be calling them weak bass i bought another pair of 7 earphones same time i purchased these  i definitely heard a big difference
49869027_R3T4YA56KPYLDA 5 my wife and i were both very pleased with our headphones they work great the shipping was very fast and overall a great transaction
30273170_R2FY6IGXCA6A22 4 decent headphones for the price would have given them five stars but the sound quality is a tad bit weak in my opinion but again given the price tag theyre not bad
1817525_R33RVJKSJTS6NW 5 ive tried many different bluetooth overear headsets the new 34sodrop34 has the best and most natural sound by far of the ones ive triedbr br i call these a headset instead of headphones because of the builtin microphone ghostek has implemented the now common feature of concurrent dual pairing the convenient thing for me is i can be listening to my music from my media hub and my iphone 6 can ringin and i can take the call through the headset which is nicebr br no bluetooth headphones ive tried has been great they all sound a little muffled to my callers and i think it has to do with the microphone placement on the earpiece but with this i havent had that problem the microphone is placed in the perfect position so that you get crystal clear call qualitybr br build qualitybr br the physical construction of the headset has soft leather cushions that fit comfortably on my ears the aluminum band is comfortably flexible over a pretty wide range this is different than some others ive tried where largeheaded individuals had uncomfortably tight fit not so with these the headband is comfortably padded and the length is adjustable so the ear pads sit comfortably centered on ones earbr br these are folding bluetooth headphones suitable for compact storage ghostek decided to include a nice storage case with the headphones which is an awesome featurebr br the ear cushions block some environmental sound these are not noise cancelling headphones so dont expect that in a loud environment you could still find that noise intrusive also some sound escapes from the headphones so i wouldnt recommend using this in a quiet environmentbr br the analog audio jack power and volume multicontrols on are the right earpiece which makes it easy and simple to usebr br on my iphone i found audio quality was greatly improved by going into the iphone settings for music and selecting 34flat34 in the eq settingsbr br pairing is so simple to do these headphones paired effortlessly with every device that i tried i tried the analog connection and these are the first bluetooth onear headphones where the analog and bluetooth quality were very closebr br other bluetooth headphones ive tried seemed focused on voicephone frequency response ranges weak on treble and bass not these i feel the sodrop has a much wider range with smooth bass at most volume levels and a good highend at the very highest volume levels distortion became intrusive but that didnt matter to me because those levels were beyond my comfort rangebr br battery life has not been a concern ive used them several hours in a day ive never run low on battery so i dont know those boundsbr br includesbr br • ghostek overear bluetooth headphonesbr • micro to usb chargerbr • audio cordbr • storage casebr • instruction manualbr br these come the closest to matching the quality of the beats or bose headphones they are very comfortable for the hour sessions that i have i was surprised by the audio quality and very pleased for that i have to rate these at 5 stars and for all you music lovers id definitely recommend these to yougsbr br pairing is so simple to do these headphones paired effortlessly with every device that i tried i tried the analog connection and these are the first bluetooth onear headphones where the analog and bluetooth quality were very closebr br other bluetooth headphones ive tried seemed focused on voicephone frequency response ranges weak on treble and bass not these i feel the sodrop has a much wider range with smooth bass at most volume levels and a good highend at the very highest volume levels distortion became intrusive but that didnt matter to me because those levels were beyond my comfort rangebr br battery life has not been a concern ive used them several hours in a day ive never run low on battery so i dont know those boundsbr br includesbr br • ghostek overear bluetooth headphonesbr • micro to usb chargerbr • audio cordbr • storage casebr • instruction manualbr br these come the closest to matching the quality of the beats or bose headphones they are very comfortable for the hour sessions that i have i was surprised by the audio quality and very pleased for that i have to rate these at 5 stars and for all you music lovers id definitely recommend these to you
32682614_R2ALTNVQ7CYPYU 1 doesnt fit
30019627_RKUYX8ARU5BMA 5 wasnt sure what to expect  love sony products never used their earbuds  i was looking for a relatively inexpensive set of earbuds to wear when doing yard work mowing weed eating blowing  i used 200 earbuds a purchased from ebay  i bought 10 thinking they would last a year or two all together four months was all 10 could handle  plus i couldnt hear anything over the equipment i was using  i would turn the volume up all the way not good for ears still hardly any sound  i bought a pair of beats and those were 90 better mower sound was still a slight problem additionally who wants to wear 100 earbuds when mowing  i purchased these hoping that they were somewhere between the ebay earbuds and beats  i was surprised at the quality of these earbuds they actually blocked equipment sounds better than the beats  i can only turn the volume of the sony to half any higher is just too loud  pros great sound quality great at blocking outside noise sturdy material and construction very nice feel in the ear  no ear canal pressure found in cheaper earbuds price  one third the price of beats and i like these better  cons  big  the actual inner ear piece in nice however the portion that is attached to them is huge  this is not a problem for me because of how and when i use them  however you could never wear them laying down they are just to big  thats it one con  i would recommend these too anyone who wants to listen to music while using equipment  on a scale of 1 to 100 i would rate them at a 95  5 dedication because of the size  really the speaker housing portion is huge
10661109_R25YRHLKYXDSZN 4 works with ipod and phone doesnt charge only plays music
51519447_R1URLY3RJGLK04 5 i dont own these headphones but i do owe the next closest thingthe wired version of them the sony mdr1as and i can say they are great headphones that are very wellrated see reviews on google have a great premium look and design super comfortable and sound great they are also foldable which is nice too for portability  these headphones have dsee on them which is a feature sony built into them which when you play music that is below hires cdquality flacalac mp3 aac etc dsee works to 34improve34 the sound quality im not a fan of it though but however i just found out from a reliable source an employee at sony that i talked to in a hifi forum that there is a way to disable dsee  but you must have a sony walkman thats ldacenabled to do so only 2 exist that i know of the a17 after updatelink httpsesupportsonycomuspmodelhomeplmdlnwza17templateid1regionid1tabdownloaddownloadtab and the nwzx2 aka the 1200 walkman which may be cheaper now if the 1abts detect that the wireless stream coming in is an ldac stream dsee is automatically disabled below is the link to see the post from sony confirming it  httpwwwheadfiorgt760674sonymdr1abtimpressions120post11865098
34212544_R2Y7UK7IM5Y46P 2 really great product and verified sweat proof  update they worked great for 2 months which is longer than the others lasted smh
44431715_R1IJ64UAR28NES 5 surprisingly good for the price
20065543_R33K6T4KYGAU9V 2 poor sound quality
29911677_R1GUIX0GSA6I0B 5 great
14973969_R20OEIG0SGEEMT 5 my son is in college he sits under the trees and listens to his music he loves it
45860688_R2RZLFPB2ROFCJ 5 wow totally blew me away i was hesitant at first but this is an awesone product the sound is great and its very comfortable  great product and kool companylook forward to many more of their products   ro
15808085_R3DKG4JUDHUETL 5 the best headphones i could have ever asked for i shopped for these for a good 2 years before purchasing them i was skeptical after buying beats by dre solos wireless and beats by dre mixers both headphones have broken in the same area so while shopping around i purchased some temporary headphones that just werent cutting it i love music and i am picky with sound even though im not a sound engineer i am a hobbyist dj that likes to spin from time to time vmodas have been on my radar for a while but the price was hurting me due to the beats breaking and after spending over 500 on headphones long story short from the moment i opened the box i knew these were it the product is worth every penny very well built and feels so good lets not forget the sound wow a very important factor is comfortability these after wearing every brand out there in the market i give them a 10 if you are interested do not wait as i did and now wished i didnt go ahead and purchase them you wont regret
8318149_R1QBVAH24TH11N 5 much better than others  like the long range capacity with no static
1028942_R3GZYZ6FFLE7W0 2 its not that 34inear34 actually can hardly reject noise like other inear ones
47653252_R12H79MIPMDFVI 5 good quality headset and attractive color choices it stays comfortably on my ears i just need to see how long it would last as it is to early at this time i am not an audiophile  to me the sound is good great to use during work out without the need for extra wire
28908206_R21NRE6JPQX0DN 1 ive been faithful to these headphones for several years and am only now writing a review in response to the ludicrous price increase from 10 to 50 i used these headphones because theyre comfortable and excellent for runningcyclingall manner of exercise but they also have middling sound and horrible durability with heavy use ive been purchasing a new pair every six months if not more frequently because the sound in one headphone will simply cut out i dont know if this is due to sweat from exercise or simple hours of usage but in either case 50 is insane for headphones that break twice a year
27131396_RURGI5QD438FB 5 recipient was happy
41255990_R2B2U0WFQU4P7C 3 i was very fond of these for a long while until i grew tired of continuously having to buy replacements for various issues  one earbud would go out and the other would still work wiring would be pulled loose from its root or other random area one earpad was entirely too soft for its own good and would rip whilst i was ever so gently trying to replace it for another size  after i sat down and thought about how much more money i could throw away buying pair after pair to replace the last i decided to cut my losses and buy an expensive pair of noise cancelling earbuds that would last me five times longer than three pairs of these combined  and indeed they havefar exceeded i might addbr br note  the only reason i am giving this three stars is because these headphones did get me through many sleepless nights for which i am ever grateful but hindered me greatly whenever they broke
147486_R1N1KZMV9HCQPZ 4 the headphones usually work great  except for the one time when they completely lost sound for nearly a minute with no determinable reason  i am also very disappointed that i have to turn the tv around and plug them in every time i want to use them as they cut all sound from the tv and according to the tv manufacturer element there is no way around this issue
14499948_R2Z0RORIQKBP7Q 4 practical nice looking and efficientbr by the way i ordered two sets by mistake in order to keep both by not returning one setamazon offered me a 1000 credit for my next purchase i need a confirmation of this offerbr thanksbr  eduardo r acle mdbr aclesrmdattnet
45304462_R177NQSR0ILH2V 5 great product received quickly and easily
17106264_R384DUZ5G7LQAK 5 i had these headphones for almost 2 years now and i highly recommend the sound quality is easily above average the bass is rich without sacrificing too much treble i have tried the over ear beats but they feel cheap and in my honest opinion are more about the name than actual quality these headphones are sturdy built with high quality and create rich sound they also look nice too
41902847_R1A2VMVRJBCFC4 1 i found this product to be at first everything i wanted i used to for the gym and when i was doing yard work i have had the product for less then 3 months and mine has already stopped working i would not recommend this if your going to be sweating
12161126_R7G0BIW2K2HBQ 5 works very well
11652088_R17EO1LH0OVYTV 4 great headphones for kids and adults i bought these for my teenage sons who use them all the time they are light weight and fit in an avergae sized purse since they fold in cancels surrounding noise which is great allows you to hear clearly through the headsets  i have since bought this style in a few other colors and the family uses them all the time
13398730_R3AB3J46CSQ1TM 3 headphones seem fairly well built and connected right with our town and country  however as has been noted by others the sound from these headphones is very quiet need to turn them up all the way to make them functional and if you press on them they produce static as well  in a pinch they are fine for kids but otherwise as the saying goesyou get what you pay for
43204695_R2BJ6H057IUCRE 1 didnt work in water after 10 minutes fine if dry but obviously not ideal for water earbuds
43603985_R1AUVGKC9MOXBI 5 purchased these as a gift for my husband he needed to be able to hear music as he was practicing drums  perfect it also blocks enough surrounding sound to be able to watch movies quietly
37315557_RMGF0QKQF8432 5 always coming back to this company great product good sound quality and extremly light on the ears for so much squeezed in good work guysbr br bt 40 so much better for battery life beating 6 hours straight
30033621_R20F1DA058OY7K 4 excellent quality sound controls on headset could be larger for easier operation
827804_R1TZQQ80Y431OK 4 these headphones are overall great for the price i would have given them five stars if i got what i was expecting unlike the picture the real thing has padding on the headband and the earpads are worse than they look in the pictures but other than that i highly recommend them and they sound pretty good
27131396_R3R0MG8ZRNC6JM 5 recipient was happy
14307723_R2AGHZLT7ASIAJ 4 this is a great pair of inear headphone with microphone that is most suitedbr for making call or listening to music i have found that it has great signal goodbr sound and they extra comfortable on my neck being light and flexible is greatbr plus the set up was a breeze no hiccups or anything after charging in a matterbr of less than 5 minutes it was up and running just pair and go very very simplebr we had owned a different pair by another maker and it was a real pain trying to pairbr but this a simplest one weve triedbr br i would not recommend them for physical activities running etc they will be fallingbr off your ear as they so light and flexible i have a skinny neck and my husband a widerbr one and both have been able to use it with out any problemsbr br listening to music has been fun with this and are sensible on my ears which has beenbr a problem with any headphonebr br all in all a great buy
42834247_RE8WZC4VSX3BH 3 they are not charging all the way so half way into my run the die  have contacted apple several times still not fixed  the seller only warrantied them for a few months better off buying from target  when they work they are awesome
46456773_R9UJY6P3D0V32 1 absolute crap lost my iphone headset in the airport and bought these thinking they would be a good stand in and gym set nope didnt even make it home before the plastic cracked on the ear piece phillips you have disappointed me for the last time
48844345_R2GA8DSS6M4XCC 5 i have always wanted a headphone amp especially one that would allow me to divide the channels up for the different members of the recording crew i saw this lyxpro 4 channel headphone amp and decided to give it a try i was unsure of what to expect at this price point but the sellers reputation made it an easy decision to try it out after running this through its paces i can say that it works very well high quality with distortion free gain much better than the audio outputs from either my mac laptop or recording interface easy to set up with rca cables sadly no usb option on this product i like the four separate output options a great way to listen to the mix for four people  led light to confirm that it has power and worked just wonderfully in the daisy chain without loss of quality not did it experience any interference   i received this promotional free item for the purpose of  testing and evaluation this review is my unbiased and independent opinion and based entirely on my examination use and personal experience with it my opinion may differ from yours however i hope that my review helps you decide whether this is the right product for your needs or not
51324432_R2KSWBW9HURS4V 3 set up was simple enough  buds are comfortable and stay in well it is easy to adjust sound from the earpiece however the sound quality is not what i had hoped for i only need to hear my music while i work out so these will do for that purpose but if great sound quality is important to you you might do better to make a bigger investment in some high end buds
37626628_RQ5Z8IM2VTZQC 5 dude these earbuds lasted me about 6 months i cant say their good quality in sound but in durability there amazing mine only just broke yesterday and i had them since feb 2015
10818797_R3R4S8RFZTHXSM 5 great cable and im able to plug into my iphone 5s with the cover still on the phone where i couldnt with a cheaper cable
43353552_R2203HP8JE3RGU 1 ive had these headphones exactly 35 days they have already broken the sides where you adjust the size is very fragile 2 weeks after buying them i noticed they were beginning to crack mind you i have only used these headphones every few days or so i do not suggest this product
49438268_R1YASSCQ7UC6S0 5 this company continues to crank out really good products at very favorable prices and these headphones are no exception  they are light easy to use and sound great  perfect for use during workouts walks and generally working around the house
36904957_R3O38KXAQUS8ID 5 great pair of headphones for our grand daughter
762862_R154DTTZLD10Q0 5 very good quality 
549152_R3AEN2YSPX3EMD 5 have you ever looked at your 200 headphones and thought34 ddamn i wish there was a better way to show off how ostentatious i am34br then this is the perfect item for you
47950941_R27VGF80ZK4G1Y 5 i have had no problems at all with the headphones  i read other reviews that said they got nothing but static and when i first set the headphones up i thought ohoh static  then i adjusted the tuning dial and voila perfect reception  they are comfortable on my ears although a bit of discomfort when they set right on where my glasses go over my ear  when i adjust them slightly that goes away  as for clarity i am not an audiophile and these arent bose my hearing is bad ergo the headphones but i am certainly satisfied with the sound quality  i ve had them for about a month and am completely pleased with my purchase  i can now distinguish conversation in movies where i used to just hear garbled noise
26345164_R1RF8XJUQ9DT25 5 this product was purchased to allow my wife to watch tv in the bedroom sound quality of the phones is really good for the price point functionality is great with the rechargeable batteries working well and providing ample power for multiple years even given daily use
798522_R3BBGZW7LV20ZJ 4 its good but not much surprise
1527018_R1PK3J2WSGYLBN 5 works fine
25408289_R1U42ETPHIWSF1 5 its good
22105057_R5G1ZS8Q6HQQV 5 good sound
34936465_R2TUJCW3HUKGXO 5 they worked great  lightweight
51458566_R2Q9KX7OURSN8A 3 i tried this running on a treadmill  no way  the neckband slide down to my back within the first minute  i do like the neckband design for wireless headphones and i use one when im just at my desk or walking around but this doesnt work when working out
14436868_R3AURD6GMKZ7MV 1 poor quality
39292449_R2BFBS8IYRO30T 5 update my first pair broke just under a year after purchase after months of mistreatment and abuse in day to day usage im rather clumsy honestly i vaguely considered rmaing them but it seems panasonics consumerfacing returnsrepairs structure has changed and the warranty these came under is no longer honored or maybe it is and i just cant find it i dont know or particularly care i gave up and just bought a new pair off amazon and thats what ill keep doing every time a pair breaks until they discontinue them the sound quality is good theyre at a great price point and the light purple color they come in is cute thats all i could possibly ask for really
15708633_R1DG8BHUV7XLPC 4 good sound  i love the fact that they are so cheep  but the color is not bluish purple as the picture shows  very girlish violet color
45074810_R21B53P9NH77FR 4 no matter how clean your ears are gunk always gets on the inside of the buds this isnt a knock to this product in particular just a generalized observation i have very small ears and the small pads fit just fine sound quality is what youd expect and noise cancellation is pretty good

46278244_RI7QUENQ2AA9M 5 this is a review for the bose soundtrue ultra inear headphones charcoal color designed for samsung android devicesbr br these inear buds offer great well balanced sound for any stereo music device but they are designed to offer inline controls and microphone support with android phones and surprisingly they work with some windows phone devices as wellbr br the buds come with small medium and large soft silicone tips that are easy to snap onto the inear speakers  the tips also have a silicone flare that helps wedge the buds in your ear and keep them in place  the flare is comfortable for extended use and it kept my buds in position while walking and jogging  given the flexibility of the silicone i think they will fit in almost anyone’s ear  the entire length of the cord is a little over 3 feet from the input jack all the way to the end of a bud  the thin leads from each bud eventually join at a hard plastic ypiece before continuing to the jack  that hard plastic y seems durable and helps to maintain spacing as the thin left and right wires go up to your ears  on the right lead between the bud and the ypiece is a small plastic button panel  it houses three buttons on the front side and a mic input on the back  the 18” jack has 3 standard connections for left and right stereo music as well as the mic  altogether the hardware is well designed comfortable durable and sweatproof  the icing on the cake is the included stylish convenient storage case that zips close  the case isn’t exactly a hard shell but it has some thick cardboardlike toughness to it that will protect your buds from any dangers they might encounter while buried in a backpackbr br the sound from these buds is wellbalanced  the lows and highs do not dominate which results in a nice dynamic blend of sound at soft and loud volume levels  they don’t sound as good as my overtheear 250 monster headphones obviously but for earbuds they are at the top of the quality list  these buds will work well for reproducing most types of music there is no active noise canceling but the silicone does an acceptable job of insulating your ears from outside noise  the microphone performance is better than i expected to be honest  the normal resting position for the mic is down against your chest but somehow the people on the other end of the phone call could still hear me  the mic performance was very good in quiet indoor rooms  while outside jogging or in the car the people on the other end of the call could still hear me but they also heard quite a bit of background noise  still the mic performance was as good as could be expected for this type of hardwarebr br the inline controls worked great on my samsung galaxy s6  the up and down buttons shift the volume  hitting the center button pauses the music and a quick double hit skips to the next track  hitting the center button once also switches over and answers an incoming callbr br as an unexpected bonus the budsmic worked flawlessly on my windows phone lumia 830 as well  i could adjust the volume pause and skip and answer calls  i can’t test all windows phones but i suspect any windows 81 or later device that supports incoming mic sounds through the headphone jack will work with these budsbr br honestly i don’t really have any complaints about these buds  with the convenient storage case they are going to become my primary travel headphones  it’s possible to complain a little about the price point but given the sound quality and expected durability they are very competitive with the other similar options out there  additionally if you’re a windows phone user and want something that will work with your phone there is a good chance these bose earbuds will have you covered  i’m happy to report that these things are a legit 5star producthey are at the top of the quality list  these buds will work well for reproducing most types of music there is no active noise canceling but

26376472_R28CM6WJV6LV3C 5 these inear monitors are an incredible value they produce a lovely bassheavy but not overpowering sound and isolate very well with the included foam tips i will be trying comply tips soon but i imagine they will not improve any more in sound from those i got these simply out of curiosity but they compare very well to my other inear monitors  the westone 3 i will say that the sound is noticeably less refined in the treble and highmids than those but at 120th the price that is more than acceptable i would say these emphasize the lows and mids as i said these are an amazing value and would be an excellent travel iem and work nicely in environments where open headphones arent appropriate fyi the cord doesnt seem replaceable they come with foam and rubber tips shipping was slow as stated but they did arrive more than a week before the quoted date the package was an envelope that was adequately protected by foam and bubble wrap
52488606_R3292O07Q6JQ09 5 this company makes really nice products
9866398_R2BIS2YAHDX7X8 2 i honestly thought i would be getting pair of epic headphonesbr i now feel cheatedbr br these sound super clear and crisp but  thats not the sound im looking for in my headphones  i wanted something bassy or earthy and these are a huge let downbr br also they are asymmetrical headphones with one bud cord being a hell of a lot shorter than the other side  and that is a huge deal breaker for mebr i wish i could get my money back because now im going to be spending another 30 on any other brand of headphones  normally id suggest sennheiser headphones but i definitely wouldnt recommend these to my worst enemy
9229231_RFMITZWDOTYZ2 2 its really much smaller and toy like in real life than how it appears on the amazon site they make it look like a full size turntable also the manual is woefully vague as to adding on additional external speakers as output connections in back are female rca connections and i myself cannot find any stereo speakers that come with male rca plugs and manual has no suggested compatible speakers the speakers that come built in are also woefully inadequate and without even the most basic tone adjustments leads to a flat hollow sounding system thankfully the reduced price makes it a less painful purchase but if anyone sees this at the full regular price run away and stay away from boytone products altogether shame on me as anything named boytone should have sent up a red flagi believed the reviews any good reviews for this are definitely  bogus or from people that have no idea about a good system for your child ages 46 boy or girl
19240561_R3IEAU1L0XNJJB 2 cushioning is peeling off after a couple weeks  doesnt fit great falls off well doing anything active
21054169_R1OGAI3O4L7GPC 5 received batteries sooner than i expected  installed and found they were already charged  appeared to be exact duplicates of my originals
46085619_R12JEGPXV1HAO9 4 ive used these for just over a month and theres a tear in the woven cover of the chord im not happy about that the wire is popping thru and gets worse everyday i dont know how to fix this im really disappointed
37951628_R2KQHW2TG1GRAZ 1 product did not work  the microphone split does not function at all  great idea lacking in execution
6728562_R95DZ2CEV0A75 5 i was scared to buy these headphones at first because of the price but it was worth it by the reviews they say they arent that good but their wrong i have an iphone 6 and these things are the best i prefer them over the apple headphones my phone came with itbr i listen to dubstep music which has a lot of bass and no matter how loud these headphones are you can still hear them i have beats bydre also and they have the same great quality only better and cuterdbr i use these everyday and you can adjust the earphones to your likingbr there the best and id buy again if i have to totally recommend
30436617_R3F4A9BM6Z8CDR 2 base is big  but flat no dimension the loss of mids and hi tone range make the sound muddy over all
1416635_R2RAY0G3W7FU1L 2 mine broke out of nowhere i picked them up and the ear piece broke off
33121058_R3UH6JAA5NRDWK 5 these are great no more batteries and we can both use our earphone off one unit
26587850_R37SF70RCI94DY 5 use it mainly for my bose ears when traveling but also like the idea i can use it with my cell phone also
23307970_R2W7KNIVVKTUFI 4 they work pretty good very good for the price not much base to them
1083176_R24FDS1D74TSC9 5 worth the 40 sound like 100 earphones and last long
42996582_R28NWFDRYYA5GW 5 good item and good cost
10431215_R2N5XRU3LLPSN0 2 a mediocre and overpriced headphones the plastic part with buttons feels very cheap and the volume down button doesnt work at all on a 400 headphones volume up and centre buttons work but they press with a crackling soundbr the sound is good though
4646484_R38BF03I6JQVTQ 4 it has its kinks it doesnt warn you when the battery is about to die it warns you a bit late when your hooked on to your bluetooth the sound quality could be better but its a well built headphones and are pretty enjoyable to work out with
17638864_R27DPB5OAHA40S 5 one of the best headphones
207099_R2FHNYMOHO7Y3C 3 arrived with one earphone having problems emitting sound maybe its a loose wire
2654601_R1U52G8S2EUKHU 1 they very bad they break easily
49121459_R3PYMAW5768IZX 5 arrived quickly feel comfortable in ear and good sound quality
7119213_R6992H44UPTLM 5 i have had these for about 6 months and i still love them they fit perfectly in my ears and are great at blocking out sound i use them for studying even without music on sometimes because they are so effective at blocking out distracting sound
45846234_R3I6AFMLITS1MX 1 these are by far the worst headphones i have ever had the displeasure of owning the awkwardly placed 34button34 is so too heavy and constantly tugs at the right headphone i tried all of the attachments until i finally determined the design is flawed and this terrible product will never stay in my ear i was hoping these would work for the gymi was so wrong
39923612_R3AAWK2EN0SC08 5 all these reviews sound like the saaame person lol
45411996_R1L96PJYTVQV20 5 i love fitness and i love music finding the right headphones for exercising can be really irritating because of comfort and fit issues i initially purchased the famous jaybirds x but for their price they were really disappointing they never fit really well water resistant wasnt good broke from rain and most importantly their battery life were terrible not even close to the advertised time after that disappointment i decided to look for another product at a much more affordable price since i didnt want to deal with warranty issues and something that wouldnt break the bank if it were to break considering i had positive experiences with brainwavz products before i decided to give these a shot and i am glad that i did the headphones arent the most secure fit when it comes to exercising but the sound is incredible for such an affordable product it has great bass clarity and most importantly a balanced sound even at max volume the bass is solid and the highs does not distort battery life is also superb compared to its competitors on one full charge i can get around 45 hours of continuous playtime which is almost double of what i received on the jaybirds now the aspect that impressed me the most about these were the build quality the wire is not too long and the headphones themselves are cased with a aluminum body which not only looks premium but feels premium also i would not feel worried if i were to drop them or put them under rough usage they feel very solid overall a wonderful product that i am glad that i have tried if you are in the market for an affordable bluetooth headphone which not only looks good but performs well these are a great choice
24456644_R3PUR8FRFN1UA7 1 this product is discontinued on monsters website cable and microphone connections are of poor quality and the microphone quit working there is no parts or documentation support on manufacturers site
115109_R3LBCF02CS9L5Z 4 i like this headset better then the lebron beats2 headset works flawlessly worth the money
51705118_R1MV5T0TLKAVJ4 5 i purchased these for my sixyearold daughter to use on our trip to colorado this summer  she loves these and i love the fact that she cant turn it up too loudly and that they fold down into a convenient travel size  satisfied customer
34319936_R1DLLDS6FTCZ2E 5 theyre a perfect fit  the original pads were a little softer but these are still great
37383928_R2HUH6HSTZR6GU 1 unfortunately within three months the right channel has quit and i have returned the headphones to yamaha  very disappointed as i have always bought yamaha products  and found them to be of good quality for the price have not heard back yet but hopefully they will be replaced
51397539_R3VNRIZFEGU8P8 2 okay product it is far from foolproof far from as advertised i should have simply bought a cheaper setup rom the start lesson learned
15750342_R1T5YUTMY3G3MO 5 only been using these headphones for one day so far i was expecting them to sound pretty good from the reviews but boy they are even better than i expected i immediately took them to the gym to test them out as i lifted weights they not only sound excellent considering their relatively low cost but they also stay put on your head no matter what your doing i honestly think you would have to stand on your head to make them move of come off  so first impressions are all positive also the hard case they come with seems to be of pretty good quality and quite durable from what i can tell  i will do an update review once ive used them for a few months to let you know how they are holding up i drive over the road 8 to 9 hours a night 6 nights week and then hit the gym about 4 days a week so these things are going to be put to the test big time right out of the box  cheers everyone
15798019_R2XTSRH6TMJRBM 3 i like the previous version of these that have different sized ear buds as it is nice to be able to change earbuds to a size that fits you
14772562_R3ALZKZDP9HLIR 5 gets the job done without tangling or fraying love the vibrant color and the sound quality when i plug my phone into my car to stream music is very good
14345714_RV82Y1874H4MK 5 excellent audio for your tv or stereo and the headphones are comfortable to wear for hours at a time
51009452_R3C069XVAMM7T4 5 one of the best investments ive made in a long time  they work perfect for a hard of hearing personhearing aids arent much help with hearing tv but with these you dont miss a word  wonderful product  worth every penny
50479789_R3V6MSGP0BUXX8 5 added lots of base
19650190_R3GHWCNQUAB35F 1 horrible product i had these headphones for less than 3 months and they will not turn on anymore charge or nothing definitely not worth 200 dollars
33903658_R1C9B2RC3NA11P 2 the earphones do not come with adjustable earpieces as most other brands do  if you use them to work outrun they will fall out
42895874_RAO60BUYK9Z4Q 4 excellent sound and comfortable  my experience with other 34intheear34 headphones has been very disappointing  they never stayed in my ears  they were also designed to block out all other soundsa safety concern for me  the bose phones stay put because of comfortable little flexible 34things34 i dont know exactly what to call them that fit into the outer ears above the ear openings  these are more comfortable than 34things34 that fit over the ear  my only concern is the fact that bose did not use a rightangle plug which judging only from my experience is less likely to fail  i use phones with a transcend mp3 player and when not in use i liked to wind the phone cord around it with the plug still in place  unlike other straight plugs with other phones ive used the phones that came with the mp3 player used a rightangle plug that never failed even after several years of daily use  i recommend disconnecting the bose phones after each use and perhaps even stowing them in the case that comes with them  five stars without that one concern trivial to most people i suppose
42195087_R38ID222MW3O6G 5 owesome seller i got the product intact no damage sounds great when i listen to the music overall 5stars i would buy more thank you very much
16035674_R2CZ3XS20GVPLJ 5 nice clear sound great fit for up to 8 hours of wear while u work it fits into your ear and doesnt wedge into your ear canal thus it doesnt create that stethoscope effect where every time you brush against the wire it sounds really loud however this wont produce very deep bass
8167828_R2LGSXRAV3XH4R 5 sound is great great price and quality
11834495_RYX8QCIA9TGVV 5 excellent quality with out a doubt some of the best ear buds ive ever used would defiantly recommend to others
1642638_R3MDOPXQHEBEHM 1 these did not fit my jaybirds had very hard time getting them on once forced on they just did not go back to the right shape
15004139_R15P1PT9PRORG6 3 good sound quality and comfortable ear buds cord tangles a bit more than apple brand earphones but im satisfied with the purchase
50615477_RXSV6FS1PD0LH 5 weve had two pairs of these for about a year one for my 25 yr old and one for my 55 year old so subtract a year from that we bought them at 1545  these have been easy for them to take onoff and adjust by themselves we have used them in cars on planes and in our home so the kids can watch something while my husband and i watch something else  we couldnt be more pleased with them  we bought several other brands and these are by far the best the biggest problem with others is that the ear pads come off and that has not been an issue with these  honestly they look brand new after a year of use  i came back to buy another set so my oldest could keep them in her kindergarten class for testing as a relatively small woman they fit me well so i am sure i will use them in the future on a plane trip
35985996_R3VD15DS8360WP 4 i have had one of these for 2 years now in occasional use it has been much better than holding the phone to my ear during long conversations or where i wanted to use my hands it connects to my samsung phone very easily the plastic headband did crack but a strip of black electrical tape fixed it i would definitly buy another of these were this one to die
27710573_R17QJBLD7MOM8D 5 excellent headset for kids i purchased a set for my 3 year old and a set my 7 year old and they adjust perfectly for each child pretty indestructible so far too i love that you can adjust the sound on these so the younger ones dont blast their eardrums i would highly recommend these to anyone
17875278_RB6ZHY5X8KA7R 1 these headphones are the worst they are not close to being genuine apple in anyway the sound is hollow it sounds like a tin can and the worst part is that the microphone fell apart the second day of use stay away from these
8634146_R3208I52YGHDEU 4 so far so good cords are long makes it easy access if you have an auxiliary input in the middle column of your car
13303464_R1TTTRT7L4NE36 5 either these or the bose quiet comfort ive tried both and went with these and i am very happybr br prosbr  the build quality far exceeds the bose quiet comforts those are made of cheap plastic and its a crying shamebr  sound quality is extremely smooth crisp but not sharp very well balancedbr  extremely comfortable comes with additional replacement earmuff padsbr  they fold thats just nice some do not and i do like the option to tuck these in a drawer easierbr  the active noise cancellation works extremely extremely well if the bose quiet comfort was 910 these would be 810 a subtle difference you may not noticebr br consbr  long use can hurt my ear cartilage i do have very large ears though  satellite sized ears its really my problem more than the productbr  the piece holding the batteries for the noise cancellation does not 34snap in34 with a nice click id like to hear meaning you could accidentally lift them up if you did it in the right waybr  the piece on the other side that is identical to the battery side is also removable its nice but i have no idea what that is for an found it strange
127901_RF5MKKI7ZWI7Y 3 once you open the pack you get to see a pouchextra earbuds the smell from the pack is something else smells like s i had to use mine under the rain to be sure the water resistant is working good music production
8698227_R8DE3S50GNYOW 5 damn good
44203799_R9JA101R1MN12 5 i love these headphones unbelievable sound quality
112654_R139VKC779O72I 5 great
24175384_R12M7SK8M1G265 2 i used to have a different pair of these my dad found them in the basement when they had been a few years old and i kept them for a long time they lasted for maybe 6 years total possibly a decade including much of the time they sat in the basement they were beautiful amazing bass quality and so comfortable like clouds on your ears that fit around and dont squish your ears against your head  but this pair is weak in durability and doesnt compare i just looked up the pair after the chord ripped at the volume changer and found this seller its great to find something that is normally obscure or not produced anymore but the internal wires of these headphones broke down with barely any wear in 2 months now i have to have the chord positioned just perfectly to hear it in both ears otherwise i get only the left side its almost impossible to get it positioned to hear in both sides i didnt do anything out of the ordinary and didnt even realize it was the headphones at first thinking my computer jack had an issue the internal wiring behind the plastic must be fragile and easily broken as the chord bends
22958009_R1E0CM6T1TDEVS 3 the sound isnt as good as i hoped and they are not noise cancelling
20131068_R1PPVNKBK1DKMV 3 the sound quality is excellent but the bass response was too weak for my tastes
1718420_R2DLD082409OVU 3 first there a little sound when it start second problem the earbuds cant control the phones sound its little big in the earbr but the sound very good and awesome
670519_R3FRXPF2TPK2DO 1 bought these earbuds about a month ago when i first opened the buds up the right bud had a longer cable than the left by about 3 inches that was a surprise a really bad one the sound quality was ok not too much bass if any im writing this review because now one of the buds is starting to die already i dont know if i just have a faulty pair or these buds are just bad i wouldnt recommend these honestly
37710944_R399FEQZYM2PNS 5 i bought these foam overs for my gogroove airband bluetooth stereo headphonesbr br at first i didnt care for them as they are a bit too large and were easily dislodged i then got the idea to layer a second cover over the first and it is perfect the extra padding is very comfortable and the covers stay in placebr br the audio does not seem to be affected by the extra layerbr br i have no idea how the cosmos fastening strap works
35286264_R3QWF5WWQCHGM5 5 these are exactly what i was looking for  i wear small hearing aids and when im sitting in the living room or ready for bed the case i have for them isnt nearby  i have one of these at each place to put the hearing aids in so they dont get lost or eaten by the dog
31170689_R1TF6D91HZMLDB 5 bought this for plane ride so we could all listen to the same movie from one ipad  works great  didnt have any volume issues
27244422_RF1WCISQD8XG0 5 for the price these are a very good set of earbuds
30813571_ROYK90605C1NI 5 i had a pair of the original bluez from the 1st production run aftershokz had  5 or 6 years now  i loved them until they died a quiet bluetooth death last week the bluez 2 sound is better the fit is more refined and they are lighter my only complaint i also had with the originals  you can start  pause songs if you want to skip you have to pull out the source device not a show stopper just a wish
2205199_RPZPFWKQYF0HF 1 worn only 2 days could not recharge the charge port broke and cant use
11397336_R38FVKCQ22414H 4 grateful there was a foam earbud replacement made now i can continue to use my earbuds very satisfied
45717426_R3QJV5BWFJZ5K5 5 i was looking for a replacement for my old qc3s  after much comparison parrot ziks beats old qc3s these are amazing they dont have the active noise cancelling of the old qc3s but they sound much better and are far cheaper than the qc3s were originally  the bluetooth features are great the battery lasts a very very long time  i love these headphones
49083656_R2ZE3711A4IMM2 5 i swim everyday with an audioflood waterproof ipod i love the ipod but have struggled finding earphones i love so far i really really like these they are reasonably priced the sound is good they offer several sizes to help you get the best fit the short cord is a huge benefit
45125813_R1VBL69UIL64XU 5 what is there to say its a case the headphones fit in it
26711014_RW8J9XMBMSJZ0 5 love love love  i have really loved having this amp in my life  the stock tubes are lousy but when paired with premium telefunken tubes this little machine pumps out beautiful detailed holographic rich sumptuous sound i recommend the bifrost uber be paired with it as a dac
8731763_R2UN50SEZG7CX5 4 very good sound
